00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.461
to this day...

00:00:02.569 --> 00:00:05.739
if we start talking...

00:00:05.863 --> 00:00:08.824
it`s four hours.

00:00:08.918 --> 00:00:11.129
It`s-it`s-it`s four hours

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.306
if we exchange a sentence.

00:00:13.394 --> 00:00:16.063
-Really?
-Yeah, and it`s like it`s,

00:00:16.158 --> 00:00:18.619
uh, it`s the center of

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.182
why we`ve been able
to sustain and, you know,

00:00:22.265 --> 00:00:25.852
why we`re still, uh,

00:00:25.948 --> 00:00:29.451
together not chokin` the life
out of each other.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.305
It`s like the ability
to work through issues...

00:00:34.397 --> 00:00:35.648
Yeah.

00:00:35.742 --> 00:00:37.160
Um...

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.805
I`ve just never--
I`ve never met another person

00:00:40.888 --> 00:00:43.141
that I-I connect with

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:49.183
in conversation more, um...

00:00:49.277 --> 00:00:51.321
blissfully and productively

00:00:51.414 --> 00:00:53.041
than Jada.

00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:55.886
Okay. I`m not even gonna
go into the big

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.024
blowout party
that you had for her--

00:00:58.138 --> 00:01:00.099
you all read it here in Will--

00:01:00.195 --> 00:01:03.073
that you laid down
the red carpet,

00:01:03.151 --> 00:01:05.112
you had all the friends
and da-da-da.

00:01:05.184 --> 00:01:07.436
And then you all ended up,
literally--

00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:09.979
I think that was the thing
that actually drove--

00:01:10.064 --> 00:01:14.318
there already was a wedge,
but that 40th birthday party

00:01:14.415 --> 00:01:18.544
was the final moment
when you said

00:01:18.655 --> 00:01:19.990
you were gonna--

00:01:20.075 --> 00:01:22.077
you were no longer
gonna be in a relationship

00:01:22.173 --> 00:01:23.966
where you were trying to
make her happy.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.460
-Yep.
-So how long were you all

00:01:25.536 --> 00:01:26.703
actually separated?

00:01:26.772 --> 00:01:28.107
We never understood how long.

00:01:28.176 --> 00:01:30.053
Was it months or years?

00:01:30.115 --> 00:01:32.284
Uh, you know,
it`s really funny.

00:01:32.352 --> 00:01:33.853
We didn`t--

00:01:35.284 --> 00:01:39.621
We never actually like
officially separated.

00:01:39.708 --> 00:01:42.627
-Uh-huh.
-Right? Um...

00:01:42.705 --> 00:01:45.958
what happened was we

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:49.783
realized that it was a--

00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:52.618
it was a fantasy

00:01:52.691 --> 00:01:57.154
illusion that we could
make each other happy.

00:01:57.231 --> 00:01:59.525
Mm.

00:01:59.611 --> 00:02:04.950
And we agreed that...

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.408
she had to make herself happy

00:02:07.508 --> 00:02:10.428
and I had to make myself happy.

00:02:10.513 --> 00:02:12.473
And then we were gonna
present ourselves

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.178
back to the relationship
already happy...

00:02:15.247 --> 00:02:16.373
Mm-hmm.

00:02:16.452 --> 00:02:19.789
Versus demanding
that the other person

00:02:19.886 --> 00:02:22.054
fill our empty cup.

00:02:22.101 --> 00:02:25.145
-Hmm.
-You know?

00:02:25.208 --> 00:02:28.086
That should be the prerequisite
for anybody actually...

00:02:28.155 --> 00:02:29.657
-Yeah.
-getting married.

00:02:29.745 --> 00:02:32.915
Absolutely. It`s like the,
um...

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.919
Come to me whole.

00:02:34.997 --> 00:02:37.834
Don`t come to me with
half of your broken self

00:02:37.922 --> 00:02:39.674
and expect me to...

00:02:39.732 --> 00:02:41.234
-And demanding me...
-to fix all the pieces.

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.863
To fill--the problem is

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:45.700
that when you come like that,

00:02:45.772 --> 00:02:47.690
the cup actually has
a hole in the bottom.

00:02:47.758 --> 00:02:49.051
Right.

00:02:49.128 --> 00:02:51.380
So you pour all your
good love in there,

00:02:51.442 --> 00:02:53.319
and it goes out onto the floor.

00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:54.758
`Cause you got
two broken people here.

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:56.634
You got two broken people,
and that`s what we`re doin`,

00:02:56.677 --> 00:02:57.845
you know?

00:02:57.928 --> 00:03:00.347
So there-there was a...

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.896
you know, we just decided that

00:03:03.976 --> 00:03:06.559
you-you have to figure out

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:08.676
how to be happy, you know?

00:03:08.744 --> 00:03:11.436
And it was a little bit
more contentious from my side.

00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:12.953
I was like, "You know what,
you go figure it out.

00:03:13.012 --> 00:03:15.445
"You go figure out
if you can be happy

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:17.856
and just prove to me
it`s even possible."

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:19.678
-Mm-hmm.
-Right?

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:21.034
Not thinkin` about
your own self.

00:03:21.118 --> 00:03:23.120
Yeah, and I`ma--yes.
I`ma do me, and...

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:24.204
-Yeah.
-you do you.

00:03:24.288 --> 00:03:26.031
And you say,

00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:28.083
"Our time apart had
helped us both to discover

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:30.127
the power of loving
in freedom.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.911
We are simultaneously
one hundred percent bound together,

00:03:32.963 --> 00:03:34.576
and one hundred percent free.

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:36.675
We agreed that we were
both imperfect people,

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:38.010
doing our best
to figure out how to be

00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:39.094
in this world joyfully."

00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:42.073
What does it mean
to love in freedom?

00:03:43.067 --> 00:03:48.822
The simple idea is...

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:51.815
You love in freedom
with everybody

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:54.711
except your partner... right?

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:58.780
Your kids are gonna go off
to college,

00:03:59.615 --> 00:04:02.508
and you`re gonna wait for them
to come back,

00:04:02.576 --> 00:04:04.636
and they might not be able
to come back this Christmas,

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:07.706
and, you know, you let them go.

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:11.001
Your friends--
there`s a certain fluidity

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:13.719
in your interactions, right?

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:16.294
It`s... it`s friendship

00:04:16.369 --> 00:04:19.234
versus marital prison.

00:04:19.747 --> 00:04:20.748
Ooh!
