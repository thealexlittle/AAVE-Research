 steve i'm just excited to have a
 live  audience i'm excited to see
 a  person i am  i've
 been in the house for three weeks
  yeah uh by the way uh
 were you friendly  with bob saget
 he's somebody you knew  right yeah
 yeah we were at shows  together
 on television we used to do 
 press junkets man  it's crazy because
 uh  the dude that you see
 on tv that's not  who that
 was not at all yeah that the
  father on full house  now
 this is a different dude also 
 both work  you know when we
 would see each other  off stage
 we would just cuss each other 
 out uh-huh you know he was an
  interesting guy what was crazy man
 my  staff just told me today
 he just emailed  me two days
 ago oh boy and they read the
  email to me this morning oh
 boy he  wanted me to come
 do this new podcast he  had
 man and uh he really respected the
  moral stances that i've taken 
 he was just talking about all the
 good  times we had and they
 read the email to  me so
 it was a little hard man today
  yeah you know he's a great
 dude man  great it's hard for
 me too because he  didn't ask
 me to do his podcast  i'm
 realizing now that he is totally 
 respected you're moral this is not a
  tribute jim  you don't do
 the tribute and slam the  dude
 at the same time  i know
 i would never slam bob but bob
  had the uh darkest sense of
 humor of any  nice person i
 ever met it was for real 
 it was shocking too shocking dark yeah
  and not just profane but also
 very  twisted and very fun to
 experience yeah  well i'm you know
 what you're turning  what you're you
 have a big birthday  coming up
 next 65. 65 years old now 
 that's a milestone that's like a 
 that's like a big party type of
 thing  are you going to have
 a party well yeah  i think
 so my wife has got something 
 planned she's really not telling me what
  it is oh i should that's
 how i know it's  expensive you
 know i'll shut it down  because
 i'm the practical one in the 
 family but my wife doesn't she doesn't
  practice practicality she don't she 
 don't know what that is i don't
 know  what the hell is wrong
 with her  don't you think there
 needs to be some  balance though
 if you're very practical  somebody has
 to bring some fun into the 
 i mean really i mean that's it
 though  you know what i mean
 she she's the fun  part of
 my life you know i know my
 job i  know what my job
 is i'm i'm i'm an  earner
  i i make i go and
 make the stuff i  provide the
 money she does sprinkles all  the
 dust  all the happy stuff for
 christmas we had  reindeer at the
 house who does that for  real
 somebody do reindeer we're black  what
 are you doing  dear when you
 were a kid was there a 
 gift like a christmas gift that you
  really wanted that you could not
 get  because your parents yeah but
 i'll give  you a prime example
 okay my daughter my  youngest daughter
 she comes to me  and goes
 dad  i want to start riding
 horses  so guess what we have
 a different life  i buy my
 daughter two horses  she's an equestrian
 rider i buy her two  horses
 i  asked my father  for
 a pony one year  about nine
 years old i asked my daddy 
 for a pony he told me you'd
 go outside  and put some hair
 on that bike  that's a big
 difference now  and i actually 
 got one of my mama's bathroom rugs
 and  took it outside and taped
 it around the  bars on the
 bike to make it look like 
 fur  now i don't get the
 pony and i got a ass 
 whooping  i got one of the
 worst answers i forgot  man 
 are you a billionaire yet steve you've
  got to be a billionaire i've
 just been  trying to add it
 all up well if i was a
  billionaire i wouldn't be on your
 show i promise you
 the day i get a billion 
 dollars  y'all give a damn what
 you caught on  family feud facebook
 this new judge show  i ain't
 gonna be on it  this 
 all right we're gonna you know i
 wanted  to take a break right
 now with steve  harvey he was
 now not a billionaire but  he
 will be soon especially if you watch
  judge steve harvey here on abc
 we'll be  right back with that
 and more steve  ruben do you
 have a phone camera  wait

 here  take a picture with me
  all right all right  thank
 you  that's all i want 
 that's great  does the winner get

 to have that picture cause  you're
 the stupidest dude  i've ever met
  at steve harvey in judge steve
 harvey  i have to tell you
 something i'm not i'm  not blowing
 any smoke up your ass here i
  would watch you do almost anything
 and  so this is such a
 great  setup for you but i
 do have one bone to  pick
 and that's this you're judge steve 
 harvey why are you not wearing a
 robe  you have you're a judge
  everybody in here know ain't no
 damn jib  but you
 got the  you have the you
 have the gavel you got  the
 bailiff you you know it's like it's
  like being a park ranger but
 you don't  wear the hat you
 have to wear the hat  no
 what  what's that man i i
 think it showed like  a disrespect
 and a disservice to the  profession
 you know i i got a high
  school diploma dog i mean that's
  that's pretty much it you know
 i just  went on and wanted
 to become a judge  everybody asked
 me so what made you  think
 you could become a judge i said
  well donald trump was present there
  that's right  you get you
 know i do a thing here on
  this show where i will rule
 on cases so  much and i
 get uh just a feeling of 
 power even though they're small claims 
 type situations that i really enjoy 
 i do too man but it's like
  like these are real people in
 real cases  and they sign an
 affidavit and whatever  i rule that's
 what it is like that guy 
 that was on the clip you showed
 i wanted  to take a picture
 with him because this  is really
 like the stupidest dude i ever 
 met  he took his he took
  the woman he sleeps with to
 court  even if you win 
 how you think this gonna work out
  i said this is the stupidest
 dude i've  ever met  and
 then abc had a little talk with
 me  afterwards cause you know steve
 it's not  politically correct to call
 anybody  stupid oh is that right
 well okay well  what what is
 he  you take your
 wife to court on tv that 
 that's not stupid  so you know
 we we're having a little  struggle
 with the political correctness  do you
 watch the bachelor on abc  yeah
 yeah  do you  do you
 think  a young single steve harvey
 how would  you handle dating 31
 women at once on  television 
 yeah  you know how many illnesses
 i would have  right now 
  you wouldn't hold back you
 wouldn't be  looking for love 
 bro let's  i know the dude
 is here and i didn't get 
 to see him back there yeah but
 if he  looks like the rest
 of them uh-huh they  have these
 tall chiseled  the  you know
 the jawlines these dudes that's  him
 gorgeous yeah  what really fine man
 is having trouble  finding  a
 woman  look  my cousin is
 a male man in dc  he's
 horribly unattractive but because
 he brings checks by once a 
 month  he got 36 women on
 his rock  well maybe he should
 be the bachelor  you wow
