00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.850
OPRAH WINFREY: Well, this is so interesting.

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.840
He was just a baby in diapers when he started

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.990
correcting other people's grammar.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.510
Sounds hard to believe.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.340
I thought it was hard to believe, too.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.440
But by 18 months,

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.980
this child could add and subtract--18 months.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.880
And by the time he was six,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.920
he was smarter than his own parents and his parents knew it.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.990
And in one year, he went from second grade to eighth grade,

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.960
and he flew through high school in just 22 months.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.790
But that's just the beginning.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.830
This genius child started college.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.930
He just did, and he's only 10 years old.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.200
Take a look.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.130
He knew the alphabet by the time he could walk.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.240
Unidentified Woman #1:  What comes after H?

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.370
GREG SMITH:  I.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.700
WINFREY:  He could tell you the history of the dinosaurs

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.370
before he was two.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.340
G. SMITH:  This is the Jurassic period.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.250
WINFREY:  Greg Smith has been on the fast track

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.420
to college from a very early age.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.550
He graduated from high school at 9,

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.320
after completing grades 9 through 11 in just months,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.230
and he did that with honors.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.490
G. SMITH:  This is for participating

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.100
in the National Honor Society.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.630
This is for being in the top 10 percent of the class.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.360
WINFREY:  At the tender age of 10,

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.970
Greg is now the youngest freshman ever

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.370
at Randolph-Macon College in Virginia.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.140
His application was a shock.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.310
Dr. JOHN CONKRIGHT:  Our reaction actually,

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.610
to be honest, was, `This must be a joke.’

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.610
WINFREY:  But this is no joke.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.480
G. SMITH:  I'm taking 5 courses, 17 credits.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.540
WINFREY:  There's physics…

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.950
G. SMITH:  Stronger angle up.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:26.810
WINFREY:   …French...

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.650
G. SMITH:  (Speaking French) Je manger cereal.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.020
WINFREY:  ...and calculus for starters.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.120
Unidentified Man #1:  A-1 times X, plus A-0.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.820
G. SMITH:  There's a number of books--my warfare

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.990
and antiquity course.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.430
I use a couple other literature books and French,

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.560
as well as Western civilization.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.460
WINFREY:  Teachers are impressed with what they see.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.370
Mr. BRUCE FRANZ:  It's wonderful to combine the intellectual

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.370
ability of an adult with the sheer unbridled curiosity,

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.840
joy and enthusiasm of a 10-year-old.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.380
Mr. BRUCE TORRENCE:  A typical student will say,

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.840
`Well, I really like this class and I'll do this class.'

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.310
Greg just wants it all, and he wants it all now.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.010
WINFREY:  Greg's classmates are nearly twice his age.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.480
Ms. KASSY MIES:  I think he might have a difficult

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.450
time because there's times in class when people are

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.160
talking about things that aren't appropriate

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.490
for a 10-year-old to hear.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:11.920
Ms. SUZANNE TETRAULT:  So far he has all my respect.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.390
Mr. BRANDON McTAVISH:  So I'm gonna ask him for study help

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.560
if I can. We'll see.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.120
WINFREY:  With 28 books to carry,

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.690
this boy wonder is getting a little help from his mom.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.490
Mrs. JANET SMITH:  Bye, sweetheart.  Have a great class.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.090
G. SMITH:  Bye.  I will.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.770
Mrs. SMITH:  I love you.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:22.560
G. SMITH:  I love you.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.000
WINFREY:  Wow.  So if you were wondering what this

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.700
10-year-old genius does at home, so were we.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.770
Take a look.  Greg at home.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.460
Greg looks like a typical 10-year-old.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.110
G. SMITH:  I love sports.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.180
I love basketball, football, soccer, tennis, track.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.890
WINFREY:  He even gets an allowance like other kids.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.480
Mrs. SMITH:  He gets $5 a week.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.040
WINFREY:  But how many children do you know buy oriental

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.520
china for their mom?

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.060
Mrs. SMITH:  Greg used his Christmas money

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.570
to buy gifts for me.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.770
WINFREY:  And get this.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.580
He likes browsing for antiques.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.980
G. SMITH:  It's Chip 'N' Dale.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.360
WINFREY:  His favorite toy?

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.110
G. SMITH:  Hmm, my favorite toy in this

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.940
whole room--let's see, I don't call it that,

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.150
but I would say my favorite thing to play with is my computer.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.160
It's hard to decide between my computer

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.340
and my Civil War figurines.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.230
This is a battle that mimics Fredericksburg.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.460
WINFREY:  Don't even think about punishing Greg

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.330
by sending him to his room to study.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.170
G. SMITH:  That's a reward for me.  I love to study.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.370
WINFREY:  Greg's idea of a good

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.240
time is to curl up with a book.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.080
G. SMITH:  One of the books I'm reading is ca--is by Plato.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.980
Right now, I'm in the "Apology" section.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.080
WINFREY:  Oh, yeah.  Well, Greg has big dreams,

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.620
so he's getting an early start.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.850
G. SMITH:  I want to get three PhDs--a PhD in

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.640
biomedical research, a PhD in aerospace engineering

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.690
and a PhD in political science.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.760
Hopefully, I'll become our president somewhere

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.660
between 40 and 50.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.060
WINFREY:  Greg, we believe you.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.230
We believe.  We believe.  So when did you know that you

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.970
were somewhat different than other kids?

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.470
G. SMITH:  Well, I always had a feeling that

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.270
I was--was--people that I was--that I knew that

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.680
I was--had a little more intellectual ability,

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.580
but I didn't really--I couldn't really

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.080
tell until I was around a larger environment in kindergarten

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.890
where I could realize what level everyone else was on.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.360
WINFREY:  So you--did you actually ever go to kindergarten?

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.470
G. SMITH:  Yes, I did.  I went to kindergarten…

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.960
WINFREY:  For an hour or what?

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.130
So, really, how long did you stay there?

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.390
G. SMITH:  I stayed half a year.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.230
WINFREY:  You did?

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.700
G. SMITH:  Yes.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:38.800
And then I moved up to first grade.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.870
WINFREY:  Uh-huh.  So when you moved to the first grade,

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.600
was that more stimulating for you?

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.400
G. SMITH:  It was.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.180
It was a good adjustment for that time and…

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.490
WINFREY:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.980
G. SMITH:  ...and that helped me test to get a little bit,

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.180
but I knew I needed more.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.460
WINFREY:  OK.  And so then did you go--you went

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.350
to second grade?

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.010
G. SMITH:  Yes.  I went to second grade the next year,

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.120
but the school that I was at wouldn't allow me to--to

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:08.070
move any fa--faster, so we--that's why we moved to Florida.

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.730
WINFREY:  Well, you moved to Florida, and then you went

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:10.810
from second to eighth?

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:11.540
G. SMITH:  That is correct.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.380
WINFREY:  That is correct.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.430
So were you doing anything in between?

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.430
What were you doing?  Were you at home reading?

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.580
Did you--we--did you--were you using flash cards?

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.320
G. SMITH:  No, my mom and dad didn't believe in flash cards.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.010
So that in that respect, when I was interested in something,

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.630
they would get books on it. They would get toys on it.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.070
We would go to the museums to learn about it.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.530
They facilitated my needs.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:36.440
WINFREY:  They did?

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.000
G. SMITH: Mm-hmm.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
WINFREY:  I know.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.570
People are la--are--are--are somewhat laughing.

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.000
They're not laughing at you.  You know that.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.510
G. SMITH:  I know.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.340
WINFREY:  Because it's just kind of amazing.  Yes.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.440
Now I understand you like discussing philosophical

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.220
a--what I want to know is how does this work with

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.510
your other--do you have friends your age?

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.980
G. SMITH:  Yes, I do.  I--with the friends my own age,

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.720
I like to play sports such as basketball, football, soccer,

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.980
tennis, rack…

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:00.790
WINFREY:  Like we saw on the tape.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:01.260
G. SMITH:  That is correct.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.690
WINFREY:  Now--and you have friends who are 10, 9, 8, 12.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.030
G. SMITH:  That--that is correct.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.530
I--and that's what I do with them. I--we play board games.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.900
We go to the movies.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.940
We--I do lots of things with them that normal

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.000
10-year-olds do.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.700
WINFREY:  You do?

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:16.170
G. SMITH: Mm-hmm.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.240
WINFREY:  Now what do you like to talk about,

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.170
though, with them?

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:19.870
You ta--talk about regular 10-year-old stuff?

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:20.610
G. SMITH:  That is correct.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.410
I ta--I try to bend to what they like as long

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.110
as it doesn't break my beliefs.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.410
WINFREY:  OK.  And your beliefs being?

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.250
G. SMITH:  I--I am very passionate about non-violence,

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.720
having high morals and a good education.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.820
WINFREY:  I understand--I've read that you like,

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.860
you know, philosophical conversations.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.220
Why do you think that you are the way you are,

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.890
so smart?

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.100
G. SMITH:  I think I've been given a special gift from God.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.660
I don't know why or how I've been given this gift,

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.340
but I want to use this gift to the best of my abilities

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.000
to help mankind.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.270
WINFREY:  Oh.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.010
Janet and Bob, say they knew the time would

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:55.670
come when their son's intellectual

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.280
ability would surpass theirs.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.550
They just didn't dream it would be when he was

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.710
six years old.  When did you first know he was different?

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:04.750
This is your only child.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:05.250
Mrs. SMITH: Yes.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:05.660
WINFREY:  Yeah.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.860
Mrs. SMITH:  And every day is a learning experience.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:12.760
But from infancy, he was just developing so rapidly,

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.730
and I was buying the books that you could find

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:16.130
in the stores about what they're supposed

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:18.260
to do at three months and six months and,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.370
`boy, he can already do this.'

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:20.600
You know, what do we do now?

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.300
And--so we've tried to ad lib the best we could.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.070
WINFREY:  Was there a moment when you said to Bob,

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.600
`I think--I think he's, you know,

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.070
more advanced or something's going on here'

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.470
or you--that--that you said to her?

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.540
Mr. BOB SMITH:  We knew that--from the time that he was

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.350
a baby because of his focus on things.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:37.710
He just seemed to be able to concentrate

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.190
and focus more than the average infant.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:39.850
WINFREY:  Really?

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.390
Mr. SMITH:  We knew there was something else there.

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:44.150
But I think probably when he f--learned to read so young

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.800
and he went through a reading program, teaching reading

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.760
skills for an afternoon…

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.560
WINFREY:  How old was he when he actually learned to read?

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.930
Mr. SMITH:  Two.  He was around two.

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:54.030
Mrs. SMITH:  Two.  By two…

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:54.860
Mr. SMITH:  Yeah, I think so.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:55.740
Mrs. SMITH:  ...he was reading…

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:56.240
Mr. SMITH:  Yeah.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.140
Mrs. SMITH:  ...regular children's books,

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.870
and by three and four, he was reading children's classics,

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.540
such as "Journey to the Center of the Earth"

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.510
and "The Last Mohicans" and "Around the World in Eighty Days.”

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:07.820
WINFREY:  Was there something you did or didn't

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.950
do that caused this, do you think?

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:12.180
Mrs. SMITH:  I think that we have an environment

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:15.930
of--we love to read as a family and I've always

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.230
made reading fun.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:20.730
We--he would sit on our lap and we would do creative ways

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.300
of reading.  We'd play with puppets.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.800
We'd make the story characters come alive.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.940
Mr. SMITH:  And when we did read to him,

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.730
we pointed to each word as we read it so he would very

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:32.210
quickly associate with those words, and before long,

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:33.410
he knew what they meant.

00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:34.550
Mrs. SMITH:  Before he was a year old,

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:35.910
he could go and get a book and bring it to us

00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:39.050
and open to a page and start saying what was on that

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:40.150
page and…

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:43.820
Mr. SMITH:  He would hear it once and be able to

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:47.950
recite it back to us, so we knew that he had extraordinary

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:49.250
learning abilities.

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:50.630
We just didn't know how much.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.420
WINFREY:  And then is there the issue of how you then

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.290
handle this?

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:54.130
Mr. SMITH: Constantly.

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:54.600
WINFREY:  Yes, constantly.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.560
Mrs. SMITH:  Every day.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.100
Mr. SMITH:  Even today.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:56.570
WINFREY:  Yes.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:57.370
Mrs. SMITH:  It's a constant worry,

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:00.030
a constant concern.  Are we making the right choices?

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.800
Are we doing the right things as a parent to--to make

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.530
him have a happy life?

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.300
And--and we worry about it because…

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:07.570
WINFREY:  Because were you worried about

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:10.970
the college decision?  Obviously, he had the--the mind,

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:11.980
the intellectual ability to…

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.950
Mr. SMITH:  That was a major--a--as late as probably April,

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:16.750
we weren't certain that he'd be able to go to

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.890
college because we could not find the appropriate environment.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.020
We lucked out in finding Randolph-Macon College,

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:24.220
which is a small college which has a policy

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.050
of nurturing each student.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.330
And we needed that for a 10-year-old with special

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:29.230
needs in college.

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:30.660
WINFREY:  Small in terms of population?

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.040
Mr. SMITH:  Small in population.  Very small per…

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.140
WINFREY:  Like how much--how many students?

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.370
Mr. SMITH: El—1,100.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:35.330
WINFREY:  Eleven hundred.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.140
Mr. SMITH:  Small pro--student-to-professor ratio.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:40.600
WINFREY:  Mm-hmm.  Were you worried, as I imagine a lot

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.570
of parents that we're talking to, about the

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.450
socialization--about his socialization,

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:49.370
and as one of the students said, you know, kids in college

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:51.480
talking about things that might be inappropriate

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.980
for a 10-year-old?

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.820
Mr. SMITH:  Sure.  And he knows more than the average

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:58.510
10-year-old about areas that we perhaps would not expose him

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:02.000
to at this point but, luckily, he has more wisdom than

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.390
the average 10-year-old, too, and I think he's been handling

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:05.160
it pretty well.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.070
WINFREY:  Yeah, not just knowledge but wisdom.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:06.790
Mr. SMITH: Right.

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:07.910
WINFREY:  So you had to have the birds and bees

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:08.960
conversation early?

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.280
Mr. SMITH:  A few weeks ago.  And i…

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.710
Mrs. SMITH:  We--but, you know, we--we really haven’t...

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:16.360
WINFREY:  But did you use birds and bees or you use the…

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:16.870
Mr. SMITH:  No, no, no.

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:17.380
Mrs. SMITH: No.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:18.920
WINFREY:  I would think you would need…

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:19.920
Mr. SMITH:  And--and very--very quickly,

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.300
he was answering for me as I was…

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:21.890
Mrs. SMITH:  Right.

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:22.480
Mr. SMITH: …describing...

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.190
WINFREY:  OK.

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:24.510
Mr. SMITH:  ...and so I knew that, you know,

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:25.870
if I—anything...

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:27.960
WINFREY:  Did you have any anxiety about that birds

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.630
and bees conversation?

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:29.290
Mr. SMITH:  Oh--oh, yeah. Sure.

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:29.810
WINFREY:  Yeah.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:30.430
Mrs. SMITH:  And I would say,

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:31.430
`It's your job to tell him about it.'

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:32.200
I would pass it.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:36.030
But it--we've had--it's been a real struggle for us as

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:39.030
a family because we want the best for our child,

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:40.110
as all parents do.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.400
And when they would come--when he'd come home from

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.140
school and we'd say, `How was your day at school?'

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:44.640
and he'd say,

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.040
`Well, I sat in the closet and read my work by

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.410
myself while the other children were working on different

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.750
things,' or `I sat out in the hall because I'm working

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:55.380
on fifth-grade work and they're still doing

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.650
the first letter of the alphabet.'

00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:59.950
We knew that that wouldn't work.

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:04.360
And we did not want him to feel embarrassed because he

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.060
had this special gift.

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.790
We wanted him to be proud of who he was.

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:08.600
WINFREY:  Yeah, as you should be.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.170
I was saying to Greg during the commercial break,

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:11.460
those of you who saw the beginning of the show

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.600
and that--what we all heard here, really profound statement

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.100
that you want to use your talents, you understand that this

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.240
is a gift, you don't know why, but use it to the best

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.940
of your ability to help mankind.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:22.840
I think you have the power to do that.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:23.410
G. SMITH:  Thank you.

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:25.640
WINFREY:  Do you feel that yourself, that you can really

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.680
make a big difference in the world?

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.610
G. SMITH:  Yes, I believe that you can make a big difference

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:34.390
in the world, and I believe that the way to make

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:36.420
this difference is through education,

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:40.660
and especially because the first step to peace is through

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:43.500
education, because education breeds understanding,

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.090
and understanding leads to alternative solutions.

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:48.660
WINFREY:  Wow.  I think you're right about that.

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:51.440
I think you're really right. Tell me why you came up

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.970
with the idea for your IEM non-violence program???

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:56.170
and how does that work?

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:58.040
G. SMITH:  Well, you look around and you hear about

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:02.110
all of the sad things, the bombings that go on and all

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:07.450
the hate crimes and it's all because someone doesn't

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:09.810
like another for a certain reason.

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:14.460
And I'm--I'm starting this program so I can--so I can

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:19.690
figure out why they do this, why do they want to hurt

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:23.310
these people, and figure out a way to reverse this.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:26.560
WINFREY:  Mm-hmm.  And so your program will do what,

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.460
specifically? G. SMITH:  For right--first,

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:34.420
I believe that the--that peace will also start with

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.310
the children, and that if we can get the children to

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:38.480
lose the hate…

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:38.930
WINFREY:  Right.

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:41.630
G. SMITH:  ...we can get the world to stop hating.

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:44.930
And with that, we can make the world a much better place.

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:50.670
WINFREY:  Congratulations.

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:51.630
G. SMITH:  Thank you.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:54.800
WINFREY:  That's a big goal.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.240
But I begin its--I believe, too, that it starts with

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.990
each individual.  It starts with each…

00:12:58.990 --> 00:12:59.710
G. SMITH:  That's correct.

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:00.910
WINFREY:  What's your favorite period in history?

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:02.750
G. SMITH:  It's hard to say.

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:06.210
There are two very--there are two periods

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:07.180
that I really like.

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:10.790
The--the city states of ancient Greece and the Roman

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:15.460
age--the Greco-Roman age for--of how much civilization

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.000
and how much technology they thought up,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.700
and we don't know much of it today.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.870
Unfortunately, the libraries were burned,

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:27.270
and the books were burned, but they had such a very

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:30.970
wonderful civilization of how they could make those

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:36.180
monolithic sculptures and had all that technology.

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:40.180
And the second period I would say is the Renaissance

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:44.290
for how they revived this perio--that period of--of

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:48.650
wonder in the Mediterranean world and brought back the

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:50.860
splendor of what the world was.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.360
WINFREY:  What do you think is the best invention

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.870
of this century?  A lot of people are talking about that.

00:13:55.870 --> 00:14:00.260
G. SMITH:  Hmm.  This century--probably the--the

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:04.900
prep--preparations for colonization of space because

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.030
that's where we're going to lead.

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:11.700
We have to go out to find--because the resources of Earth

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:17.650
will some day be very low, and--and in space,

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:22.380
the resources are ti--may be in infinite amounts.

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:25.990
And there's so much to know and so much to explore.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.050
WINFREY:  Thank you.

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:28.750
G. SMITH:  Thank you.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:32.120
WINFREY:  Yes.  How do your other classmates in college

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:36.100
relate to you? G. SMITH:  The--they're very nice.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:37.800
They're very sociable.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.560
WINFREY:  Do they ever ask to see your homework?

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.900
G. SMITH: No.

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:42.410
WINFREY:  No.

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:43.100
G. SMITH: No.

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:43.710
WINFREY:  No.

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:44.980
What are your fears for him?

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:50.070
Mr. SMITH:  Well, we've always been afraid that--we look back

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:52.890
over the years and find that there's been gaps in--you know,

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:56.990
in a normal child's experience, and we've constantly

00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:59.430
debated wi--amongst ourselves about that,

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:01.300
and even--and talked to Greg about it.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.700
As--as late as a few weeks ago, we were trying to talk

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.470
him out of going to college because we just weren't sure

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.170
it was appropriate, but …

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:09.870
WINFREY:  But why did you want to go so much--so badly?

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.240
G. SMITH:  I have a passion for learning,

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.840
and I believe that every moment that I spend to the

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:20.150
pursuit of knowledge is time worth spent to help mankind.

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:23.520
WINFREY:  And so you'd already outgrown high school

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:24.250
and you knew it?

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:25.190
G. SMITH: Yes.

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:26.190
WINFREY:  Mm-hmm.

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:28.120
And you want three different PhDs?

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.060
G. SMITH:  That is correct.

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.320
I would like a PhD in biomedical research,

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:37.300
a PhD in aerospace engineering and a PhD in political science.

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:38.430
WINFREY:  Because?

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:42.340
G. SMITH:  With my first PhD in bi--in aerospace engineering,

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:46.050
I'd like to design space stations, as well as colonize other

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:49.710
planets and mine asteroids. With my second PhD in biomedical

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:53.310
research, I would like to find cures for diseases such as

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:56.480
cancer and AIDS, as well as figure out a way for the

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:59.620
regeneration of cells in humans and the reduction of the

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:03.280
aging process. With my third PhD in political science,

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.350
I would like to become the president of the United States,

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:11.030
as well as maybe our appointee to the United Nations

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:15.800
and try to find a way for world peace and to stop world

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:16.970
poverty.

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:18.800
WINFREY:  I hope I'm still around to vote for you.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.020
I really do.  Thank you so much.  Thank you so much.

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:22.520
G. SMITH:  Thank you.
