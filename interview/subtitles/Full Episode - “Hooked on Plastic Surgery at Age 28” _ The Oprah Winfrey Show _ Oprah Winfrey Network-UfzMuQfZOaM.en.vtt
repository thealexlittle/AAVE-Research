00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.020
Unidentified Man #1:  OK, stand by, here we go.
Lights, music.

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.590
 OPRAH WINFREY:  Twenty-six surgeries and she's only 28. 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:06.490
 Ms. JENNY BURTON:  He said to me, 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.820
 `I'm warning you, your nose will collapse,' 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.450
 and I said, `I'll roll the dice.' 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.910
 WINFREY:  Nose, breasts, 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.520
 cheeks--you name it. 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.760
 You looked at Michael Jackson's nose and said, 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.370
 `That's the nose I want.' 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.140
 Addicted to plastic surgery. 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.970
 If his wife gets one more lipo, he's gone. 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.100
 Do you mean it when you say you're going to leave? 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.580
 And a moment that stopped our show. 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.140
 Mrs. CHERYL KAISER:  I can't.  I'm done. 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.700
 WINFREY:  Next.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:59.550
 Hi.  Hi.  Thank you. 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.240
 Whoa, whoa, whoa.  All right then. 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.610
  OK.  OK, have a seat. 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.230
 Thank you for coming. 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.160
 OK. 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.920
 Well, OK, 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.810
 this is going to be interesting, 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.170
 because they are America's newest junkies. 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.060
 They put their bodies through agony. 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.260
 They rack up thousands of dollars of debt. 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.900
 Some are destroying their families. 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.620
 Some are destroying themselves. 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.430
 Jenny Lee Burton is only 28 years old, 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.680
 and listen to this, she's already 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.460
 had 26 plastic surgeries. 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.300
 That's true. 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.060
 Ms. BURTON:  Growing up, people would tell me that I was such a 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.460
 pretty little girl and that I should be a model, 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.950
 and they said I resembled Julia Roberts a lot. 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.020
  I don't think I look like Julia Roberts anymore. 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.710
 WINFREY:  That's because Jenny Burton says she 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.990
 became a slave to the scalpel. 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.210
 It started with one critical comment. 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.760
 Ms. BURTON:  My ex-husband told me that 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.750
 my nose was too big, that my boobs 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:53.640
 were too small. 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.540
 So eventually, I got a boob job 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.490
 to stop the comments. 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.460
 It just moved from a bad relationship 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.390
 with him to a bad relationship 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.700
 between me and my reflection. 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.560
 After the divorce, plastic surgery 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.710
 became an obsession for me.  

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.500
 Today I look nothing like I did when 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.270
 I was married to my ex-husband. 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.720
 Plastic surgery for me is like a drug 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.260
 because it's all I can think about.  

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.830
I brought my plastic surgeon pictures of what I wanted: 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.220
 Michael Jackson's thin nose, 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.360
 Angelina Jolie's lips, Jennifer Lopez's profile, 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.310
 Jennifer Aniston's jaw and cheek bones. 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.010
 I was 25 when I had my brow-lift--25. 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.070
 WINFREY:  She's also had Botox, 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.210
 cheek implants, three nose jobs, 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.900
 veneers on her teeth, three lip implants, 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.120
 two boob jobs, three breast lifts, 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.170
 and liposuction on her arms, 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.840
 stomach, hips, thighs and knees. 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.320
 Ms. BURTON:  The total cost of everything that 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.600
  I've had done is about $80,000. 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.420
  WINFREY:  But even all these surgeries have failed to stop Jenny from 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.040
 scrutinizing her imagined imperfections.  

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.890
 Take a look. 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.770
 Ms. BURTON:  I don't know what perfection is for me. 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.780
 I don't want this look. 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.020
 I'm trying to avoid looking completely unnatural. 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.660
 WINFREY:  Jenny says the seduction of perfection is worth the pain. 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.920
 Ms. BURTON:  Whatever the postoperative pain that 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.710
 I'm going through is not near as bad 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.420
 as the way I feel when I look at the mirror 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.290
 and I see something I'm very unhappy with. 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.110
 And I had told my doctor, I said if I could do 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.330
 this every day of my life, I would. 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:39.450
  Every day. 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.820
 WINFREY:  But Jenny's addiction to plastic surgery 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.490
 has left her self-esteem more shattered 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.260
 than ever before. 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.570
 Ms. BURTON:  People don't recognize me in 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.560
 some of my older family pictures, and they say, 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.700
 `Who's this person?'

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.390
 and they're in shock.  And they said, 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.590
 `What have you done to yourself?' 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.990
 I wish I had never started this. 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.510
  I feel like I'm broken and that I need to be fixed. 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.380
 WINFREY:  What do you see when you look in the mirror now? 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.480
 Ms. BURTON:  I still see a lot of imperfections. 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.050
  I still see a lot of things that are wrong. 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:20.130
 I still want other things done. 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.820
 I'm unhappy with stretch marks left from pregnancy 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.240
 and I would like a tummy tuck.  

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.940
 I still see imperfections in my nose and wrinkles 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.520
 around my eyes, and all kinds of stuff. 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.610
 WINFREY:  And you're 28. 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.290
 Ms. BURTON: Twenty-eight. 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.220
 WINFREY:  And you're 28.  OK.  You're 28.  

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.770
 Now, see, I'm looking at you.  

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.860
 You look kind of--you look like Barbie to me. 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.550
 Ms. BURTON:  That's what my daughter says. 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:43.660
 WINFREY:  Yeah, you look like Barbie. 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.580
 You look like eve--doesn't she look like Barbie? 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.220
 Audience:  (In unison) Yeah. 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.880
 WINFREY:  OK. 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:53.170
 And I think that's good if you work for the Mattel company, you know. 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.890
 Ms. BURTON: Yeah. 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.300
 WINFREY:  I think that's, you know, good. 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.310
 But what is inside you that you think needs 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.960
 to be fixed that causes you to not be able 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.560
 to look in the mirror and like what you see? 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.260
 Ms. BURTON:  It's been a battle that I've had with my poor 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.630
 self-esteem that started a long time ago. 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.010
 And the continuous need to feel like I should 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.190
 fit in somehow and I never can fit in, so I... 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.810
 WINFREY:  And so do you think that there's something 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.040
 you can do to your nose? 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.520
 Do you think the next surgery will make your nose be 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.360
 whatever or your lips be whatever? 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.620
 Is there something you can do to your body 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.400
 that's going to make you fit in?  

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.810
 Do you logically think that at this point? 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.080
 Ms. BURTON:  I don't think anything I do to my nose 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.910
 or to my body will make me fit in, 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.630
 because I just don't think I do fit in. 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:46.880
 I'm trying to achieve some sort of acceptance 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.910
 and contentment with my reflection, 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.780
 and I know where I'd like my nose to be. 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.170
  I don't think it's possible that it will ever get there. 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.640
 WINFREY:  Where do you want it to be? 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.130
 Like you looked at Michael Jackson's current nose- 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:03.160
 I'm asking this as a serious question- 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.740
 and you looked at Michael Jackson's current nose, 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.100
 and you said, `That's the nose I want.'

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.220
 Ms. BURTON:  I wanted to make sure that my plastic 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.610
 surgeon understood that I wanted my 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.280
 nose drastically thinned out, so in order to 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.270
 give him an example, 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.430
 Michael Jackson was a great example. 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.930
 WINFREY:  OK. 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.680
 Ms. BURTON:  I like the way that Jennifer Lopez's 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.570
 nose looked from the side, so I wanted it- 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.250
 I wanted the projection to go down, 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.510
 and so I used those two pictures...  

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.180
 WINFREY:  So you've already had, though, how many nose jobs? 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.810
 Ms. BURTON: Three. 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.230
 WINFREY:  Three nose jobs.  Let's go back to look 

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.680
 at Jenny's original picture where you said 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.470
 people used to tell you you looked like Julia Roberts. 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.030
 Tell me what was wrong with that picture? 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:45.710
 Ms. BURTON: Nothing. 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:46.730
 WINFREY:  OK. 

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:47.530
 Ms. BURTON: Nothing. 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:48.620
 WINFREY:  Nothing was wrong with that picture.  

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.850
 See anything wrong. 

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:56.710
 When you look at the two pictures, 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.400
 who is the prettier to you? 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.940
 Is one prettier than the other? 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:05.090
 Ms. BURTON:  I think that sh--that this picture is just a 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.630
 different person, and I think that the picture on 

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.190
 the left is equally as beautiful as the 

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:12.870
 picture on the right. 

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.040
 WINFREY:  OK.  Let's look at your nose there. 

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.180
 So you've had three nose jobs. 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.510
 What was wrong with your nose then that 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.310
 you felt that it needed to be different? 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.630
 Ms. BURTON:  I was told by my ex-husband that 

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.990
 it was too big and that it needed to be changed and, 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.970
 along with other things, and nobody had ever 

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:29.370
 said that to me before.  

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:31.390
 So I thought, well, surely all these people, 

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:33.370
 I guess, were trying to be nice to me all 

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.300
 of these years and tell me how cute 

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.660
 and pretty I was, and he was the 

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.010
 only one that was honest with me. 

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:40.220
 WINFREY:  Keyword here is ex. 

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:40.860
 Ms. BURTON: Ex. 

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:41.850
 WINFREY:  Keyword here is ex. 

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:45.010
 Ms. BURTON: Yeah. 

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:48.040
 WINFREY:  Yeah.  So now you re--do you regret all the surgeries? 

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:52.050
 Ms. BURTON:  I regret not taking enough time to think about all 

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:56.990
 of the things that I had done.  I just jumped into it.  

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.320
 I got the money to do it and I did it.  

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.290
 And I--it--I mean, I spent more time thinking 

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.660
 about what kind of house I was going to buy, 

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.990
 what kind of car I was going to drive, 

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:07.280
 than I did what I was going to do to myself 

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.450
 permanently that would last me for the rest of my life. 

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.990
 WINFREY:  OK.  So would you say you're an addict?  You would... 

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:14.820
 Ms. BURTON:  I would say I'm obsessed with it. 

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:15.870
 WINFREY:  You're obsessed with it. 

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.490
 Ms. BURTON:  I would say--I don't know what an addict 

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:19.840
 is when it comes to--like I've never been 

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.070
 addicted to drugs.  

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:22.540
 I've never been addicted to alcohol.  

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:26.210
 So if this is what addiction is, then, yes, 

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:27.140
 I'm addicted to it. 

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.530
 When I think about it all the time and it... 

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:31.380
 WINFREY:  You think about it all the time? 

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.310
 Ms. BURTON:  All the time, every day. 

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:33.270
 WINFREY:  And you said on the tape that you 

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:35.010
 would--if you could do it every day, you would. 

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:35.680
 Ms. BURTON:  Every day. 

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.040
 WINFREY:  And when you mean do it, you mean 

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.540
 like go under the knife and be cut? 

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:39.720
 Ms. BURTON: Mm-hmm. 

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.750
 WINFREY:  You would do it every day? 

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:44.030
  And the feeling that you're looking 

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.240
 for is not the going under the knife and being cut, 

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.860
 but whatever results from that? 

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.930
 Ms. BURTON:  The end result, hoping that there will be 

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:53.730
 something better that awaits me when it's all over. 

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:54.290
 WINFREY:  OK.  

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:58.460
 And when you realistically ask yourself that question, 

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.780
 what do you think that could be?  

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.910
 Because you've done it, and you've done it, 

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:04.230
 and you've done it, and you've done it, 

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:05.190
 and you're not satisfied. 

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:07.100
 So realistically when you look in the mirror 

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.090
 or you examine yourself and you say 

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:11.740
 `I'm now going to have'--what 

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.790
 do you want to have done next? 

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:14.690
 Ms. BURTON:  So many things. 

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:16.630
 WINFREY:  So many things.  OK, like what? 

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:19.630
 Ms. BURTON:  My number one priority right now is 

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:23.540
 the Botox around the eyes for the crow's-feet. 

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.270
 WINFREY:  Are these cheek implants or what... 

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:25.670
 Ms. BURTON: Mm-hmm. 

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:26.740
 WINFREY:  You have cheek implants.  

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:31.230
 OK.  So you now want Botox around the eyes because? 

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:33.030
 Ms. BURTON:  I'm trying to prevent wrinkles. 

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:35.400
  I'm trying to prevent them from making the permanent 

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:39.650
 lines in my face that then have to be--face-lift, 

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:43.090
 you know, where they cut you to pull it back. 

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:44.140
 WINFREY:  But you've had a face-lift, right, or did you... 

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.660
 Ms. BURTON:  I've had--brow-lift. 

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:46.490
 WINFREY:  Brow-lift, OK. 

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:48.680
 So a brow-lift is just--What?--from here to there? 

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:49.640
 Ms. BURTON: Mm-hmm. 

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.910
 WINFREY:  And they cut this and then lift that? 

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:52.570
 Ms. BURTON:  They cut you from ear to ear. Yeah. 

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:53.870
 WINFREY:  They cut you from ear to ear, 

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:56.760
 mm-hmm, and do that and then pull up your brow. 

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.370
 Ms. BURTON: Mm-hmm. 

00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:58.610
 WINFREY:  Yeah. 

00:09:58.610 --> 00:09:59.750
 Ms. BURTON:  Cut your muscles in between your eyes 

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:00.490
 and so that you can't... 

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:01.390
 WINFREY:  Frown. 

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:02.350
 Ms. BURTON:  ...make the mean face. 

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:04.520
 WINFREY:  OK.  And then what else do you want done? 

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.790
 Ms. BURTON:  I would like a body lift which is 

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:11.350
 basically circumferential. 

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:14.190
 They cut you all the way around your stomach 

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:19.830
 and kind of to your rear, and like pulling up a pair of pantyhose. 

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:21.470
 They just pull it up, so it... 

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:22.510
 WINFREY:  And what would you be pulling up?  

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:23.140
 I'm trying to figure... 

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:23.660
 Ms. BURTON: Skin. 

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:24.600
 WINFREY:  You'd be pulling up your skin, 

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.140
 so you're cut from around your waist... 

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:28.030
 Ms. BURTON:  Like a tummy tuck, but it extends 

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:30.630
 all the way to the back, and it goes down, 

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.230
 and it lifts your rear, the sides, 

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:36.110
 the front, like a tummy tuck, and then 

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:38.710
 they do it in the inside of your leg to do an 

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:40.000
 inner thigh lift.  

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.700
 You know, obviously, I would probably need 

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.780
 a lower face-lift where, you know, 

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:48.630
 when I'm 60 probably to have the skin pulled 

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:50.730
 back here and then they do 

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:53.400
 an arm lift where they cut from here to here, 

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.010
 and they take the skin so, you know, 

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:58.850
 if I'm 60 or 70 and I've got excess skin... 

00:10:58.850 --> 00:10:59.720
 WINFREY:  Yeah.  Yeah. 

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.740
 Ms. BURTON:  ...flapping, then I'll... 

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:02.230
 WINFREY:  Yeah, I know.  I have that now.  

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:07.450
 I call them my flags.  Yeah.  OK. 

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:10.010
 Remember, Jenny's only 28 years old 

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:13.660
 and has had 26 plastic surgeries.  

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:21.600
 We'll be right back. Next, why Jenny's sister fears for her life. 

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.810
 And later, a liposuction addict on the verge of losing everything. 

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:27.410
  We'll be right back. 

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:29.540
 

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.840
 

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.820
 Ms. BURTON:  My daughter's almost 10. 

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:39.420
  Her whole life, I've been having the plastic surgeries, 

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:43.310
 so she doesn't even know what I look like as a natural person.  

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:46.700
 I've always had a discussion with my daughter, 

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.160
 `I might not make it out of surgery.'  

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.600
 She cries and, you know, asks why I'm having the surgery.  

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.180
 She says, `Mommy, you look like a Barbie doll.  

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.580
 Why do you want to do something?'  

00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:00.100
 But I can't help it.  I really can't help it.  

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:03.280
 When my daughter sees pictures of me before I had any 

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.930
 surgery, she doesn't recognize that that's me. 

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:08.390
 We don't even look alike.  

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:12.740
 I miss the resemblance that I had with my father.  

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:22.680
 That's the worst. 

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.720
 WINFREY:  The truth is we are a nation obsessed 

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.620
 with perfection, and Jenny Lee Burton is 28 years old 

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.990
 and has had 26 plastic surgeries, 

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:34.920
 five on her breasts, four to enlarge her lips, 

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.160
 three nose jobs, cheek implants, 

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.930
 and a brow-lift. 

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:42.390
 She's also had liposuction on her legs, on her hips, 

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:45.030
 on her stomach, on her arms, and as we were just discussing, 

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:46.920
 she still wants more. 

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.310
 We asked Jenny's younger sister, Lauren, 

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:52.800
 how she feels about Jenny's obsession with her looks. 

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.090
 Ms. LAUREN DAVIS:  I'm 18, 

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:57.550
 and my sister started plastic surgery when she was my age. 

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:00.370
 WINFREY:  Jenny's plastic surgery has made her sister, 

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:03.130
 Lauren, feel insecure about her own looks. 

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:06.020
 Ms. DAVIS:  I feel like she's rejected my looks, 

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:07.850
 as well as hers. 

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:09.820
 I'm self-conscious about, you know, 

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.080
 the way my nose looks now and how my 

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.830
 eyebrows are too low or my breasts are 

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:17.990
 too small or my hips are going to become too big. 

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:20.260
 WINFREY:  At the same time, Lauren sees 

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:24.330
 her sister's radically changed appearance as disturbing. 

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:25.960
 Ms. DAVIS:  Honestly, I don't think that 

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.000
 she would look as good as she would if she never 

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.470
 had plastic surgery. 

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:33.090
 I think that she looks plastic, I think fake almost, 

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:35.560
 and materialistic.  

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.610
 When we walk down the street, it's noticeable. 

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:40.740
  It's almost kind of like a circus clown. 

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.410
 I think she cut herself short. 

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:45.700
  And she was beautiful even before she had her surgery. 

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.020
 WINFREY:  Mostly, Lauren wishes she and Jenny 

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.910
had something most sisters share: 

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:51.680
 a family resemblance. 

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.420
 Ms. DAVIS:  It hurts to know that my sister's 

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:58.600
 changed her face so much that we don't look alike. 

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.870
 WINFREY:  Do you think Jenny will ever stop? 

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:03.450
 Ms. DAVIS:  I don't think so. 

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:05.890
 Only because once you start, 

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:08.120
 she's going to have to continue on 

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:12.580
 and fix little things down the road. 

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.850
 WINFREY:  Until she fixes herself. 

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:15.530
 Ms. DAVIS: Right. 

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:17.050
 WINFREY:  Until she fixes her real self. 

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:20.110
 Dr. Nancy Etcoff is a psychologist who teaches 

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:21.400
 at Harvard Medical School. 

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.370
She's also written a book called "Survival of the Prettiest: 

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:26.230
 The Science of Beauty." 

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:28.040
 Isn't--this is indicative--I know everybody's 

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.390
 like gasping and `Oh, my God' 

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:31.750
 and every time she mentions something, 

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:34.130
 but this is who we've become as a nation. 

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:35.440
 Dr. NANCY ETCOFF:  Exactly.  We are a nation... 

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.430
 WINFREY:  That's the truth, people.  

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.480
 Can we just all look at ourselves in the mirror? 

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.780
 This is who we have become as a nation, correct? 

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:41.720
 Dr. ETCOFF:  Absolutely.  

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.160
 We're a nation obsessed with beauty, 

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.390
 pursuing it at all costs. 

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:46.740
 We see images of perfect beauty everywhere. 

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.880
  I'm also hearing something that people 

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.490
 often don't know about called body 

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:52.450
 dysmorphic disorder, BDD. 

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:54.030
 WINFREY:  OK.  BDD.  OK. 

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:55.490
 Dr. ETCOFF:  And what the... 

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:56.400
 WINFREY:  And what does that mean? 

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.110
 Dr. ETCOFF:  It's a psychiatric problem 

00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:00.460
 where people are preoccupied with an imagined 

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.010
 or very slight defect.  

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:04.160
 They can't stop thinking about it. 

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.850
 They check the mirror all day. 

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:07.680
 They spend hours thinking about it. 

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.850
 They'll ask people, `How do I look?' 

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:12.610
 Does this sound like something you've done? 

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:14.170
 Ms. BURTON:  Textbook. 

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:14.770
 Dr. ETCOFF: Yeah. 

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:15.900
 WINFREY:  Well, this is what I thought was so interesting. 

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:19.060
 You want Jennifer Aniston's chin. 

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:21.430
 You want the side profile of Lopez. 

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:22.900
 You want somebody else's something. 

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:26.310
  And you put all of those together, they weren't meant to be... 

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:27.080
 Dr. ETCOFF: Yes. 

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:27.990
 WINFREY:  ...you know. 

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.610
 Dr. ETCOFF: Yes. 

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:34.500
 WINFREY:  That's what's odd to me.  Yes, sir?  Yeah. 

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.390
 Unidentified Man #2:  The question I have to ask 

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:40.670
 is how many plastic surgeons have you been to? 

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:42.000
 Ms. BURTON:  Just two. 

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.200
 Unidentified Man #2:  Just two. 

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:47.150
 And at no point did--was there any point that the 

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:48.400
 plastic surgeon sat down with you 

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.380
 and said, `You know, this is enough, I think you 

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:54.500
 need to seek out psychiatric counseling?' 

00:15:54.500 --> 00:16:02.870
 Ms. BURTON:  Many times, many times. 

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:05.500
 WINFREY:  Yeah.  That's on my question list.  

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:10.360
 Are you a plastic surgeon? 

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.050
 Unidentified Man #2:  Yes, I am. 

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:11.570
 WINFREY:  OK. 

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:13.200
 Ms. BURTON:  Many times, I've gone 

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.510
 into the doctor and asked--even begged for 

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:20.690
 something else, and he sends me away and says, 

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:22.570
 `If you still feel the same way in a year, 

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:25.410
 then come back and we'll talk about it.' And... 

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:26.360
 WINFREY:  And then you come back in a year? 

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.790
 Ms. BURTON:  I come back in a year that--I 

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:29.750
 write it on my calendar and come back in a year. 

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:32.830
 WINFREY:  Really?  What does your husband think, 

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:33.930
 your current husband? 

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:38.450
 Ms. BURTON:  He thinks that I am the most 

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:39.550
 beautiful woman in the world, 

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:42.040
 and he wishes that I'd never do anything else again. 

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.640
 WINFREY:  Where are you getting--is your husband rich? 

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:45.900
 Ms. BURTON:  We live a comfortable life. 

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:46.370
 WINFREY:  OK.  

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:48.410
 But, I mean, because aren't these surgeries expensive? 

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:49.320
 Ms. BURTON:  They are expensive. 

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:49.830
 WINFREY:  Yeah. 

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.140
 Ms. BURTON:  And I--but I was a single mom for a long time, 

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.570
 and I would work extra jobs and eat peanut butter 

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:55.680
 and jelly sandwiches. 

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.610
 WINFREY:  In order to get the surgery. 

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:58.110
 Ms. BURTON:  I would just save every penny. 

00:16:58.110 --> 00:16:59.590
 I'd max out every credit card I had, 

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:01.070
 whatever I could do. 

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.330
  So, you know, if... 

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:05.230
 WINFREY:  So the question is have 

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:07.720
 you sought psychological counseling? 

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:08.930
 Ms. BURTON:  Mm-hmm. 

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:10.850
 The agreement I have with my psychiatrist now, he said, 

00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:12.850
 `I want you to stay out of the plastic surgeon's 

00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:15.590
 office for five years. Promise me that.' 

00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:19.390
 I said, `I can't promise anything.  I'll try really hard.' 

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:20.590
 WINFREY:  This is so interesting to me. 

00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:21.720
 This is fascinating to me. 

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:22.730
 I'm sure it is to you, too.  

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:24.340
 Where is your self? 

00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:28.240
  Where is the self that knows who you are? 

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.020
 Because three or four times here, 

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.870
 you've said your ex-husband told you this 

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:33.660
 and your sister's told you this, your 

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:36.140
 family told you this, and your doctor told you this. 

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.910
  What do you think?  

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:39.600
 Where's your self? 

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.800
 Ms. BURTON:  I feel like my spirit was broken, 

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:48.860
 and I'm trying very hard to find acceptance. 

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.300
 But when I look at my reflection, 

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.270
 I still don't like what I see, so 

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:58.690
 I'm trying to grow, to accept what I see and like it. 

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:01.060
 And if I could be just OK with it, 

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:04.540
 just OK, I would be very happy just to be OK. 

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.720
 WINFREY:  Next, this woman's husband 

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.740
 says one more surgery, he and the kids 

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:10.080
 are going to be out of there.  

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:18.160
 We'll be back. Interesting. 

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:22.640
 WINFREY:  We're talking to women who say they're 

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.520
 hooked on plastic surgery. 

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.220
 OK.  Cheryl Kaiser is a mother of two who admits that 

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.980
 she's addicted to liposuction, 

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.980
 and she's willing to do anything to get it. 

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:31.530
 Take a look. 

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:34.500
 Mrs. KAISER:  All you see is a big fat huge 

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.570
 stomach with stretch marks. 

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:38.520
 WINFREY:  When Cheryl Kaiser looks at her 

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.630
 reflection, she hates what she sees. 

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:41.890
 Mrs. KAISER:  I would think that you were 

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:44.810
 seeing someone ugly, someone fat. 

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:47.090
WINFREY:  To her, the answer is simple: 

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:48.310
 plastic surgery. 

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:50.570
 Mrs. KAISER:  And once I started, I can't stop. 

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:52.200
 WINFREY:  What seemed like a quick fix 

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.110
 rapidly grew into a full-blown obsession. 

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:57.370
 Mrs. KAISER:  I've had a breast reduction, 

00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:01.020
 liposuction of my upper abdomen, lower abdomen, 

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:05.030
 love handles in the back, tummy tuck, tightening 

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.390
 of my stomach muscles. 

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:09.790
 It's like an alcoholic addiction, except it's 

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:11.430
 with plastic surgery. 

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:12.540
 WINFREY:  Cheryl's obsession is taking 

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:14.510
 a toll on her entire family, 

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:16.620
 especially her husband, Brad. 

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:17.760
 Mr. BRAD KAISER):  I'm done. 

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.860
  I've had enough with the plastic surgery. 

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.830
 Our household can't take it anymore. 

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:24.960
 It doesn't benefit me, and it doesn't benefit my children. 

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:28.280
 WINFREY:  The plastic surgery bills have put the family in serious debt. 

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.890
 Brad works three jobs to pay off Cheryl's 

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:33.220
 $15,000 medical tab. 

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:34.580
 Mr. KAISER:  It's not only a financial thing. 

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.510
 It's hard to live in a house where somebody's 

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:38.850
 always so unhappy about themselves. 

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:41.680
 WINFREY:  Brad and Cheryl both worry about their two children. 

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.590
 Mr. KAISER:  I have an 11-year-old daughter 

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:44.600
 and a nine-year-old son. 

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.270
 I don't need them growing up to be obsessive 

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:47.540
 about their weight or their looks. 

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:49.310
 Mrs. KAISER:  My daughter, Carley, 

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:52.650
 she doesn't want me to do it.  

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:55.570
 She tells me every day how beautiful I am.  

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:58.310
 But Carley's not a small girl, and 

00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:01.930
 I don't want her following in my footsteps. 

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:03.860
 WINFREY:  The final straw for Brad came when 

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:08.110
 Cheryl told him she wanted liposuction on her legs. 

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:09.680
 Mr. KAISER:  I just simply said it wasn't an argument. 

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:13.100
 You get it done, I'm leaving.  I mean, it's over. 

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.230
 I'm prepared to get a divorce and take our kids. 

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:19.730
 Mrs. KAISER:  He's tired.  He's tired of it all.  

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:21.850
 We can't afford it. 

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:25.130
 I mean, we refinanced our house to do this, 

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:29.150
 so I need to stop. 

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:32.720
 WINFREY:  Is it true you scoured your house 

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.760
 looking for stuff to sell to pay for surgery? 

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:35.520
 Mrs. KAISER:  Yes. Yeah. 

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.430
 WINFREY:  Yeah. 

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:38.020
 Mrs. KAISER:  I sold lots of things. 

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:39.190
 WINFREY:  When did this start with you? 

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:41.250
 Mrs. KAISER:  After my second child 

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:44.030
 is when I started the breast reduction. 

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:45.260
 WINFREY:  You started the breast reduction. 

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:45.810
 Mrs. KAISER:  And then... 

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:46.820
 WINFREY:  And how did you feel when 

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:47.660
 she first said, 

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:48.740
 `I want breast reduction'? 

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:50.000
 Mr. KAISER:  I was behind her because 

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.250
 it was her self-image.  

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:54.110
 She felt very self-conscious and just... 

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:55.140
 WINFREY:  About her breasts. 

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:55.870
 Mr. KAISER:  Her looks. 

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:59.080
 She just felt--she wouldn't dress sexy.  

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.360
 She would cover herself up when we would go out.  

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.390
 A lot of times, she wouldn't want to go out. 

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:06.350
 WINFREY:  OK.  So you were OK with the first breast reduction. 

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:06.890
 Mr. KAISER: Yes. 

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:08.200
 WINFREY:  OK.  And then what happened? 

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.890
 Mrs. KAISER:  Then after the first breast reduction, 

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:13.780
 I went to the liposuction on my lower abdomen 

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.670
 and my love handles.  And then after... 

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:18.470
 WINFREY:  What about working out and all that? 

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:19.200
  What about that? 

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.460
 Mrs. KAISER:  I won't get into... 

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:23.800
 WINFREY:  No, I'm just asking, 

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.660
 I'm just asking, what about that? 

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.110
 Mrs. KAISER:  I worked out, but I won't get 

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:28.740
 into the workout clothes. 

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:31.330
 I don't want people to see me--of 

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:32.680
 what I look like in workout clothes. 

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:33.570
 WINFREY:  In workout clothes. 

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:34.520
 Oh, so you're one of those people, 

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.570
 you want to get thin before you go to the gym. 

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:37.170
 Mrs KAISER: Correct. 

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:38.920
 WINFREY:  Oh, OK,  All right.  

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.360
 And so you got the love handles, OK. 

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.460
 Mrs. KAISER:  I got the lower abdomen and the love handles. 

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:45.480
 WINFREY:  OK.  And were you satisfied? 

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.090
 Mrs. KAISER:  No, you're never satisfied. 

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:47.940
 WINFREY:  You're never satisfied. 

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:48.430
 Mrs KAISER: No. 

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:48.850
 WINFREY:  No.  

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:51.100
 Were you satisfied, or it didn't matter to you? 

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.150
 Mr. KAISER:  It didn't matter to me. 

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:53.210
 I was satisfied before. 

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:54.520
 WINFREY:  You were satisfied before. 

00:21:54.520 --> 00:22:00.460
 But then when she had the liposuction here 

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:01.800
 and then the love handles, 

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:04.210
 were you then thinking, 

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:05.100
 `We got a problem'? 

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.450
 Or when did you start to think this was a problem? 

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:07.800
 Mr. KAISER:  No, I still was behind her, 

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.420
 because she had had--after 

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.080
 she--while she was pregnant, 

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:16.040
 she had appendicitis with our son.  

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:18.530
 And it kind of left a pouch.  

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:20.210
 So once again, she was very self-conscious.  

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:21.920
 Because of her self-consciousness, 

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.230
 it also affected us in the bedroom and places... 

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:27.480
 WINFREY:  Brad, do you--self-consciousness 

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.090
 would do that in the bedroom. 

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:31.080
 Tell me this, do you mean it when you 

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.150
 say you're going to leave? 

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:33.330
 Do you mean that? 

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:34.070
 Mr. KAISER:  Yes, I do. 

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.680
 WINFREY:  You will leave. 

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:35.160
 Mr. KAISER: Yes. 

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:37.110
 WINFREY:  And it's not just about the surgery. 

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:38.170
 It's about what? 

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:40.710
 Mr. KAISER:  It's about her needing to change herself... 

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:41.290
 WINFREY:  Yeah. 

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:44.810
 Mr. KAISER:  ...look at herself, because--I'm sorry. 

00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:46.250
 WINFREY:  No sorry. 

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:47.590
 You say you would leave, but 

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:58.250
 you don't want to leave. Oh.  Take a moment. 

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:01.170
 You don't want to leave, but you've had enough. 

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:04.210
 You've had enough and you don't know what to do. 

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:05.110
 Mr. KAISER:  That is correct. 

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:08.080
 I wish she would just get help for herself... 

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:08.840
 WINFREY:  OK. 

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.400
 Mr. KAISER:  ...to realize she is a beautiful person. 

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:15.360
 WINFREY:  Are you willing to risk your marriage over this? 

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.800
 Mrs. KAISER:  No, I don't want to risk anything. 

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.450
 I want my marriage to stay. 

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:19.800
 WINFREY:  You want your marriage to stay.  

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.540
 Here's a man who obviously loves you. 

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:28.050
 He obviously loves you and he obviously 

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:29.370
 loves your thighs.  

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:32.950
 He loves you and loves your thighs. 

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:34.840
 But that has nothing to do with the 

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:37.690
 way you feel about your thighs. 

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:38.160
 Mrs. KAISER: No. 

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.050
 WINFREY:  OK.  So what do you think would 

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:41.170
 change if you had liposuction on your legs now? 

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:43.900
 Mr. KAISER:  My legs would be smaller. 

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:46.710
 WINFREY:  And then? 

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:49.560
 Mrs. KAISER:  Maybe I could get into a bathing suit. 

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.030
 WINFREY:  And then? 

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:54.230
 Mrs. KAISER:  Maybe I could get into clothes that I like.  

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:59.100
 It will never end. It's always, OK, well, this looks good. 

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.760
  Let's do something else. 

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:01.840
 WINFREY:  OK. 

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.430
 Mrs. KAISER:  If he would never say what says, 

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:05.950
 I'd go back in. He... 

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:08.200
 WINFREY:  You would go back in. 

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.150
 Mrs. KAISER:  Oh, yes, I'd go back in tomorrow. 

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:10.920
 WINFREY:  He... 

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.180
 Mrs. KAISER:  If he would say that he 

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:13.850
 would not leave me, I--he's 100 

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:16.020
 percent behind me, I'd be back in. 

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:18.170
 WINFREY:  Ok.  Even though you put yourself into financial... 

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:20.020
 Mrs. KAISER:  We refinanced our house. 

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:21.440
 WINFREY:  Refinanced your house. 

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.090
 Mrs. KAISER:  He works three jobs. 

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:25.490
 WINFREY:  And he works three jobs. 

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:26.620
 Mrs. KAISER: Yeah. 

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:30.200
 WINFREY:  So what kind of life is that? 

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.020
 What kind of life is that really? 

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:34.720
 This is so interesting to me because 

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.390
 I think what you're s--you--when you say 

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:39.250
 `I could get into the bathing suit,' 

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:41.320
 the reason people want to get into bathing suits 

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.870
 is because of the feeling that is 

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:45.030
 created and the--ultimately you're looking 

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:47.480
 for companionship and to be loved, 

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:50.960
 and you seem to have that from him... 

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:51.400
 Mrs. KAISER: Correct. 

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.690
 WINFREY:  ...and your children obviously love... 

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:53.290
 Mrs. KAISER: Correct. 

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:54.430
 WINFREY:  ...and care for you.  

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:58.140
 So I am just confused as to what it is 

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:00.090
 you think the bathing suit or the next--

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:02.970
 you know, an inch or two inches or whatever 

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:04.870
 it is out of your thighs is going to do. 

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:05.960
 Mrs. KAISER:  Until the day I look in the mirror 

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.880
 and say `I'm perfect,' that'll never happen. 

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.490
 Dr. ETCOFF:  And that, unfortunately... 

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:13.310
 WINFREY:  Well, who is perfect?  Tell me who is. 

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:14.750
 Mrs. KAISER:  Well, not perfect, but until I look and say 

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:16.090
 `I'm comfortable with myself.'

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:17.700
 WINFREY:  And what would that have to take to 

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:19.630
 make you be comfortable with yourself? 

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:20.670
 Mrs. KAISER:  More surgery. 

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:21.990
 WINFREY:  More surgery. 

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:24.350
 Dr. ETCOFF:  I will tell you that surgery won't do it, 

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:27.150
 that you can look at Jenny's experience, 

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:30.230
 your own, and you'll just go back for more and more, 

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:32.720
 and it will not change.  

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.510
 You know, you cannot change.  

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:36.110
 There's not a myth of transformation where 

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:38.000
 you wave a wand and suddenly you're 

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:38.850
 a different person. 

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:40.640
 Good feelings come from inside. 

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:41.130
 WINFREY:  Yeah. 

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:41.870
 Dr. ETCOFF:  Come from inside. And... 

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:49.440
 WINFREY:  But you can relate, obviously.  Right?  

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.610
 You can obviously relate. 

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:51.500
 Ms. BURTON:  Very much so.  

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:56.300
 My husband loves me exactly the way I am, 

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.920
 and the parts about me that are his 

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:02.100
 favorite are the ones that I want to change. 

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.680
 So I'm trying to convince myself 

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.700
 to leave them alone because he loves 

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:11.100
 them so much, so it's a battle. 

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:13.440
 It's like a war within myself. 

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.470
 WINFREY:  Cheryl, when you look at Jenny, 

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:15.320
 do you see yourself? 

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.090
 Mrs. KAISER: Yes. 

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:17.900
 WINFREY:  You do.  You see yourself. 

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:18.720
 Mrs. KAISER: Yes. 

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:19.550
 WINFREY:  You know what that feels like. 

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:20.160
 Mrs. KAISER: Yes. 

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.160
 WINFREY:  To think about it all the time. 

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.420
 Mrs. KAISER:  I think ev--I can't look into a mirror. 

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:25.840
 If I have to stand there and look into a mirror, 

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.410
 do my hair in the morning, 

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:29.900
 I will stand far back away because I don't 

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:31.200
 have my glasses on. 

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.780
 I can do my hair, that's it.  

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:34.680
 I don't need to see anything else. 

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:38.060
 WINFREY:  We'll be right back. 

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:44.160
 Next, she was a beautiful society girl who stole 

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.460
 money and posed nude to feed her addiction to the knife. 

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.840
 We'll be right back. 

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:52.620
 

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:56.350
 

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:59.730
 WINFREY:  Hope Donahue's life reads like the profile 

00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:03.050
 of a junkie and her drug of choice was plastic surgery. 

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:07.710
 WINFREY:  Once upon a time, in Los Angeles, 

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:10.400
 below the sun-kissed palm trees of 

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.270
 one of the city's wealthiest neighborhoods, 

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:15.210
 there lived a pretty little girl named Hope. 

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:16.420
 Ms. HOPE DONAHUE:  I seemed to have everything. 

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:18.380
 I was beautiful.  I had money. 

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:19.640
  I went to debutante balls. 

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.150
 WINFREY:  Hope was obsessed with being pretty.  

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:25.100
 She spent hours a day primping, but strangely 

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:27.900
 she feared the very attention she craved. 

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.790
 Ms. DONAHUE:  I felt people were staring at me. 

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:31.930
 I had anxiety attacks, couldn't breathe. 

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:35.800
  It was a huge irony, because on the one hand, 

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.970
 I was completely focused on my looks, 

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:40.550
 and my life depended on being on beautiful. 

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:43.420
 And on the other hand, I felt under such scrutiny. 

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:44.690
 WINFREY:  Though she had no job, 

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:47.260
 Hope had great credit, more than enough 

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:49.610
 to correct the facial flaw she felt 

00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:51.870
 came between her and perfection. 

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:54.220
 Ms. DONAHUE:  I thought, I'm going to fix my nose 

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:56.790
 and I'll live happily ever after.  

00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:59.770
 I was 22 years old when I had my 

00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:02.920
 first surgery.  I had a nose job. 

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:06.910
 WINFREY:  But the quick fix she had longed for was an illusion. 

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:08.740
 Ms. DONAHUE:  When the bandages came off, 

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:10.630
 I regretted that it wasn't a bigger change. 

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:13.020
 I basically wanted a new personality but, 

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:14.070
 you know, I didn't get that. 

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:15.100
 I just got a new nose. 

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:16.810
 WINFREY:  The next surgeries were more drastic:  

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:20.500
 Gortex inserts to widen her lips and implants 

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:23.950
 to plump her cheeks; again, all paid on credit. 

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:26.060
 The procedures took hours and left 

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:28.830
 Hope bruised and emotionally distraught. 

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.660
 Ms. DONAHUE:  My whole face was distorted. 

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:31.740
 I didn't recognize myself. 

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:33.220
 That was definitely a low point. 

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:36.870
 I thought, what have you done to yourself? 

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:39.150
 WINFREY:  Hope's parents were so horrified 

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:40.930
 by what she was doing to herself, 

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:42.520
 they cut off her allowance. 

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:45.370
 Hope began stealing to pay for her plastic surgery. 

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:47.400
 Ms. DONAHUE:  I was afraid that I couldn't stop. 

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.370
 I didn't know what was going to stop me. 

00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:51.330
 I was maxing out all the credit cards 

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:53.200
 and I actually started to steal from my roommates. 

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:58.900
 WINFREY:  By now, she'd had five surgeries all before her 24th birthday. 

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:02.180
 But like a drug addict, Hope was looking for her next 

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:04.380
 fix and spiraling towards rock bottom. 

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:06.460
 Ms. DONAHUE:  I really felt like my life was a 

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:09.580
 tra--like a slow-motion train wreck, 

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:11.660
 and I was watching it and I couldn't stop it. 

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:14.710
 WINFREY:  Convinced that happiness was one suture away, 

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:18.610
 Hope found new a plastic surgeon in the classified ads. 

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:20.280
 Ms. DONAHUE:  And he started out by complimenting 

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.810
 me and telling me how beautiful I was. 

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:24.070
  And then he'd say something like, 

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:27.310
 `Well, if you just did something more to your nose, 

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:30.020
 you would look 70 percent more beautiful,' 

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:31.820
 and I would be devastated. 

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:33.020
 I would think, 70 percent. 

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:35.690
 WINFREY:  A year after her first surgery, 

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:38.750
 at just 23, Hope had a face-lift. 

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:40.330
 Ms. DONAHUE:  And I would stop by his 

00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:41.810
 office a couple of times a week even 

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:42.910
 if I didn't have an appointment. 

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:46.300
 WINFREY:  In the weeks that followed, she had more lip surgery. 

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:48.430
 Then collagen injections. 

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:50.510
 When her own credit finally ran out, 

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:52.410
 Hope used her parents' credit cards 

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:54.560
 and charged her surgeries to them. 

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.000
 Ms. DONAHUE:  There got to be a point where 

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.170
 I had done everything on my face. 

00:29:57.170 --> 00:29:59.650
 There wasn't a feature that I hadn't messed with.  

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:01.920
 So it occurred to me, breasts. 

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:04.110
 How about bigger breasts? 

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:07.280
 WINFREY:  This was the longest, most painful surgery yet.  

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:10.630
 The agony of recovery persisted for weeks. 

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:13.770
 Ms. DONAHUE:  It was like somebody was burning me 

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:16.540
 with a lighter inside my breasts. 

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:18.370
 It was the most agonizing pain 

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:19.890
 that I'd ever experienced.  

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:22.030
 I didn't talk to anybody.  I didn't see anybody. 

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:23.630
  It was a very lonely existence. 

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:26.550
 WINFREY:  Desperate, this former debutante 

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:29.480
 began posing nude to support her addiction. 

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:33.490
 Ms. DONAHUE:  I came in, and I took off my clothes. 

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:35.930
 I saw something out of the corner of my eye, 

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:37.630
 and it looked like it was a harness or something 

00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:39.430
 hanging--it was hanging from the ceiling.  

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:40.700
 And I said, `Well, what are those?'

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.980
 and he said, `Oh, that's for my bondage work,' 

00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:44.600
 and then he proceeded to show me some 

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:45.710
 photographs that he had taken and it was 

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:47.580
 just absolutely horrifying, but that 

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:50.670
 was really a moment where I realized what I was doing. 

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:54.150
 I did hit bottom that day. 

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:57.740
 WINFREY:  We'll talk to Hope when we come back. 

00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:02.370
 

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:10.020
 

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:12.650
 WINFREY:  Hope Donahue is the 

00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:14.920
 author of a new memoir called "Beautiful Stranger," 

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.940
 which chronicles her addiction 

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:19.160
 to plastic surgery. 

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.680
 And so the bottom for you was... 

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.150
 Ms. DONAHUE:  In the pornographer's office. 

00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:25.610
 WINFREY:  ...in the pornographer's office. 

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:26.380
 Ms. DONAHUE:  Yeah, yes. 

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:26.810
 WINFREY:  Yeah. 

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:27.780
 Ms. DONAHUE:  I was so broke and so desperate 

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:29.630
 for money and attention that I ended up 

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:33.030
 in a bondage photographer's studio. 

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:35.700
 WINFREY:  So you realized that you needed help, 

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.700
 that it was--you were sick. 

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:39.890
 Ms. DONAHUE:  Absolutely. 

00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:41.870
 I knew I was sick at that point. 

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:43.910
 Yes.  In the beginning, I didn't see it like that. 

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:46.420
 It was, I'm just going to do my nose, 

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:49.330
 and that's it, and then I'll be fine. 

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:50.590
 WINFREY:  Do you realize you're sick, Cheryl? 

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:52.480
 Mrs. KAISER: No. 

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:53.730
 WINFREY:  You don't think you're sick? 

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:55.050
 WINFREY:  You think you're sick?  

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:56.410
 You know you're sick? 

00:31:56.410 --> 00:31:59.980
 WINFREY:  OK.  So you can see them, and you can hear them... 

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:00.680
 Mrs. KAISER:  After hearing them... 

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:02.620
 WINFREY:  And they're sick, and they were 

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:03.520
 sick and they know it. 

00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:05.310
 She's sick and she's--know it. 

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:06.340
 Do you still feel that you're sick 

00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:07.580
 or did you feel like you healed yourself, Hope? 

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:08.820
 Ms. DONAHUE:  I'm a recovering addict. 

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:09.740
 WINFREY:  You're a recovering addict. 

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:10.370
 Ms. DONAHUE: Absolutely. 

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:11.390
 WINFREY:  Recovering... 

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:13.220
 Ms. DONAHUE:  Absolutely. 

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:15.790
 Mrs. KAISER:  That's where I want to be. 

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:16.810
 WINFREY:  That's where you want to be. 

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:17.970
  OK.  Help me understand this. 

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:19.060
 I mean, I was saying to the audience, 

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:20.460
 I think I've had almost every ailment 

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:21.580
 all my guests have had.  

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:23.160
 This I haven't had. 

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:23.740
 Ms. DONAHUE: Right. 

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.350
 WINFREY:  I've had, you know, eating issues. 

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:25.820
 Ms. DONAHUE: Right. 

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:26.710
 WINFREY:  I can relate eating 

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:28.120
 issues to alcoholism and other things.  

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.180
 I can't figure out what this is. 

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:30.670
 Ms. DONAHUE:  Right, right. 

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:31.210
 WINFREY:  I can't... 

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:36.170
 Ms. DONAHUE:  Well, for me, it was--put it this way. 

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:39.120
 If I had not had access to plastic surgery and plastic 

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:41.640
 surgeons, I'm sure I would have had another 

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:44.350
 addiction, and i--whether it would have 

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:50.010
 been anorexia, bulimia, cutting myself, it's the same pain. 

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:54.040
 WINFREY:  When you have plastic surgery, is it painful? 

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:56.140
 Ms. DONAHUE:  The recovery is very painful. 

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:57.250
 WINFREY:  Recovery is painful. 

00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:57.940
 Ms. DONAHUE:  Oh, absolutely, yes. 

00:32:57.940 --> 00:32:59.460
 WINFREY:  But it's not painful while you're doing it? 

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:01.250
 Like you're under, you're out or something. 

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:01.960
 Ms. DONAHUE:  You're out, under. 

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:02.610
 WINFREY:  OK.  And then... 

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:03.560
 Ms. DONAHUE: Right. 

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:04.700
 WINFREY:  ...does it depend on what you 

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:06.170
 do as to whether it's painful? 

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:08.600
 Ms. DONAHUE:  Pretty much I think everything 

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:12.990
 is painful, because it's--you are cutting into your body. 

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:13.620
 WINFREY:  You're being cut.  Yeah. 

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:14.430
 Ms. DONAHUE:  You're being cut. 

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:16.830
 WINFREY:  OK.  And the bottom for you came when you looked 

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:19.050
 at the photograph of yourself in the porn place. 

00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:20.290
 Ms. DONAHUE:  Well, it was more than that. 

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:23.130
 It--I had gone severely into debt.  

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:24.740
 I was stealing. 

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:25.760
 WINFREY:  And that's why you were 

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.070
 in the porn place, to make money so you could 

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:28.000
 have more plastic surgery. 

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.060
 Ms. DONAHUE:  Well, I told myself I was in the 

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:30.530
 porn place to make money, but I was really 

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:32.370
 there because, all along, what I always 

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:33.260
 wanted was attention. 

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:34.210
 I wanted it from the doctors. 

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:37.230
 I wanted who--somebody to pay attention 

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:39.180
 to me and somebody to love me 

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:40.490
 and see me.  

00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:43.430
 So bottoming out for me was a combination. 

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:46.310
 WINFREY:  Your eyes teared up when you said, 

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:47.700
 `I wanted somebody to love me and see me.'  

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.210
 Is this what this is all about for you? 

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:51.870
 Ms. DONAHUE:  For me, yes, it was. 

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:52.830
 WINFREY:  And when was the last time 

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:54.790
 you had a face fix or a body fix or... 

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:59.770
 Ms. DONAHUE:  The last surgery I had was about 10 years ago... 

00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:00.260
 WINFREY:  Oh, 10... 

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:01.700
 Ms. DONAHUE:  ...and I had the implants taken out. 

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:07.850
 WINFREY:  So you--how did you help yourself?  

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:11.470
 Because this feels like--if you're addicted to drugs... 

00:34:11.470 --> 00:34:12.090
 Ms. DONAHUE: Absolutely. 

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:14.320
 WINFREY:  Yeah.  How did you then help yourself? 

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.810
 Ms. DONAHUE:  Well, I was in therapy. 

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:16.570
  I went to therapy.  

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:19.120
 And actually, it wasn't until about three years ago 

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:21.640
 that I saw a psychiatrist for the first time, 

00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:25.820
 and I started describing my whole history, and he said, 

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:28.170
 `Oh, you have OCD.'  

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:30.590
 And it just clicked. 

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:31.510
 WINFREY:  OCD. 

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:33.060
 Ms. DONAHUE:  Obsessive-compulsive disorder. 

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:34.350
 WINFREY:  OK.  Now tell me this. 

00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:37.230
 I've been watching your forehead, and it hasn't moved. 

00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:38.940
 Ms. DONAHUE:  I had Botox in it. 

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:41.620
 WINFREY:  OK.  So--and that's how I know 

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:43.130
 whether people do it, because--yeah, OK.  

00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:45.020
 So I'm talking to you, so I don't know 

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:46.110
 if you had a brow-lift or whatever.  

00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:48.300
 But your forehead hasn't moved this whole time.  

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:49.870
 So you've had Botox. 

00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:52.030
 Ms. DONAHUE:  I did.  I have fallen 

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:55.130
 off the wagon, which is how I equate it. 

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:57.510
 WINFREY:  Yeah, because you just told 

00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:59.190
 me you hadn't had it in 10 years and then I look... 

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:00.740
 Ms. DONAHUE:  Well, that--right.  I haven't a surgery since... 

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:01.360
 WINFREY:  OK. 

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.960
 Ms. DONAHUE:  Yeah.  I've had a few procedures. 

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:03.790
 WINFREY:  OK. 

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:04.700
 Ms. DONAHUE:  But I haven't had a surgery 

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:05.670
 since having the breast implants out. 

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:07.880
 WINFREY:  OK! 

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:08.440
 Ms. DONAHUE:  I know. 

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:09.790
 WINFREY:  What does that mean? 

00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:10.930
 What does that really mean? 

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:14.570
 I mean, does that mean that you fell off the wagon?  

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:17.360
 Would that be like an alcoholic 

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:21.380
 having not, you know, 10 shots of tequila 

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:22.850
 but a glass of wine? 

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:23.830
 Ms. DONAHUE: Yes. 

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:24.260
 WINFREY:  OK. 

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:24.660
 Ms. DONAHUE: Yes. 

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:25.080
 WINFREY:  OK. 

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.460
 Ms. DONAHUE:  If--yeah, because--well, 

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:30.950
 what happened was recently I had to go on a 

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:33.720
 business trip, and I was very anxious, 

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:35.840
 and I didn't know how to control that anxiety, 

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:39.010
 and so I went back in and got the Botox, and... 

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:42.390
 WINFREY:  What did that feel like to you? 

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:43.970
 Ms. DONAHUE:  Like I had failed. 

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:44.980
 WINFREY:  Like you had failed. 

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:46.140
 Ms. DONAHUE:  Like I had failed. I... 

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.530
 WINFREY:  Wha--you mentioned a couple of other procedures. 

00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:51.520
 Ms. DONAHUE:  I've had collagen... 

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:52.140
 WINFREY:  Collagen. 

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:55.530
 Ms. DONAHUE:  ...in my lips and then Botox... 

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:56.340
 WINFREY:  Botox. 

00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:56.930
 Ms. DONAHUE:  ...a few times. 

00:35:56.930 --> 00:35:59.410
 WINFREY:  So you've done injections--collagen 

00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:01.140
 injections, Botox injections. 

00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:01.550
 Ms. DONAHUE: Right. 

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:04.180
 WINFREY:  Anything else you want to confess to me today?  Yeah. 

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:09.190
 Ms. DONAHUE:  I have actually--can I take a drink of water? I'm... 

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:10.380
 WINFREY:  Yes, have as much as you want. 

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:12.730
 Have as much as you want.  Here. 

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:14.090
 Ms. DONAHUE:  Thank you. 

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:16.010
 WINFREY:  Yep. 

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:19.470
 Ms. DONAHUE:  I have over--the past about seven years, 

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:22.360
 I've booked and then canceled prior to 

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.610
 surgery four nose jobs. 

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:28.830
 WINFREY:  What would happen that you would cancel? 

00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:30.320
 Ms. DONAHUE:  You know what? 

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.460
 I can't fool myself into thinking--I 

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:33.920
 can't fool myself anymore. 

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:36.220
 I cannot fool myself into thinking 

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:39.820
 that a smaller nose is going to equal a happier me. 

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:40.660
 WINFREY:  Yeah. 

00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:41.590
 Ms. DONAHUE:  I know that doesn't 

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:42.720
 work anymore because I tried that. 

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:43.620
 WINFREY:  You know that. 

00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:44.370
 Ms. DONAHUE:  I know that. 

00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:50.940
 WINFREY:  We'll be right back. 

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:57.550
 

00:36:57.550 --> 00:37:03.140
 

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:05.200
 WINFREY:  We're talking to women who say 

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.920
 they're hooked on plastic surgery. 

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:13.040
 OK, Cheryl, you think a smaller thigh is going to make a happier you? 

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:13.580
 Mrs. KAISER: Yes. 

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:16.290
 WINFREY:  You think a smaller--you do. 

00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:20.720
 You think that if your thighs are smaller- 

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:22.270
 and how much smaller do you want them? 

00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:23.990
 Mrs. KAISER:  Not much, just a little. 

00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:25.330
 WINFREY:  Ju--you think--OK, 

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:27.020
 you don't even want much.  You just want a little. 

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:27.810
 Mrs. KAISER:  No, I don't want much. 

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:30.510
 WINFREY:  OK.  So you think if your thighs are a little... 

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:31.920
 Mrs. KAISER:  Just so they don't touch. 

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.640
 WINFREY:  That would make what difference in your life?  

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:37.610
 Would it make your children happier, you happier? 

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:38.390
 Mrs. KAISER:  No, it'll make me happier. 

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:39.080
 WINFREY:  It will make you happier. 

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:41.630
 Yeah.  OK.  Jenny, this--as we were sitting here- 

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:44.970
 as I was sitting here with you earlier, I heard you breathing 

00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:47.400
 (makes sniffing noise) and you were doing that a lot. 

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.780
 Can you breathe through your nose well? 

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:49.820
 Ms. BURTON:  Not well. 

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:50.700
 WINFREY:  Not well.  Yeah.  

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.750
 My producers tell me you need a Q-Tip 

00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:54.710
 sometimes to open up your nostrils 

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:55.520
 to breathe.  Is that true? 

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:56.260
 Ms. BURTON:  I can't blow my nose 

00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:58.790
 like normal people can, so if I want 

00:37:58.790 --> 00:38:00.830
 to breathe really good, I have to get a Q-Tip out. 

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:05.000
 And if I don't have Q-Tips, I might have an anxiety attack. 

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:05.790
 WINFREY:  Oh, really? 

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:06.230
 Ms. BURTON: Yeah. 

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:07.660
 WINFREY:  So if you got another surgery, 

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:08.720
 you would likely--if you 

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:11.840
 get--if it gets any narrower, I don't know how 

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:12.890
 you're going to get any air up there. 

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:14.940
 You know what I'm saying? 

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:16.210
 Ms. BURTON:  It is a problem.  And a lot of people, 

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:19.800
 you know, they go into a plastic surgeon's 

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.570
 office and they bring a picture of a 

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:23.380
 celebrity or whoever and they say... 

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:24.750
 WINFREY:  And you took Michael Jackson's nose. 

00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:26.130
 Ms. BURTON:  I took Michael Jackson and I said, 

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:27.720
 `This is what want.'

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:28.190
 WINFREY:  Yeah. 

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:29.640
 Ms. BURTON:  And my doctor said, 

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.160
 `Genetically, I can't give you that.'  

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.010
 And I said, `Well, get as close as you can.'  

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:36.120
 And there's no way that you could possibly 

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:39.180
 do that with what you're given and expect 

00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:40.710
 those kind of results, so then... 

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:41.120
 WINFREY: No. 

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:42.560
 Ms. BURTON:  ...you end up coming back and back and 

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:44.000
 back, trying to whittle it down.  

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.630
 And the last time I went in there, 

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:49.260
 he said to me, `I'm warning you, 

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:53.190
 if I do this, there's a very good possibility your 

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:56.230
 nose will completely collapse and it will be 

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:58.300
 flat on your face and we will have to 

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.010
 start all over again,' 

00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:02.870
 and I said, `I'll roll the dice.' 

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:04.010
 Unidentified Woman:  Oh, my God. 

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:08.270
 Mrs. KAISER:  I can't.  I'm done.  I can't. 

00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:11.230
 I don't want to roll the dice. 

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:14.570
 WINFREY:  You don't want to roll the dice. 

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:15.610
 Mrs. KAISER:  Just--the light bulb went off. 

00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:17.300
 WINFREY:  A light bulb went off. 

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:25.030
 Mrs. KAISER: Yes. 

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:34.910
 WINFREY:  Tell me. 

00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:38.530
 Mrs. KAISER:  No way.  I have two children and my husband. 

00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:43.900
 WINFREY:  Tell me what just happened. 

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:45.730
 What part of the light bulb and can 

00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:47.370
 she bring it back and turn it on again? 

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:49.810
 What happened? 

00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:52.310
 Mrs. KAISER:  The--to roll the dice with my life, 

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:53.820
 to lose my kids, lose my husband, 

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:55.500
 I'll stick with the legs. 

00:39:55.500 --> 00:40:01.950
 WINFREY:  Yes!  Yes!  We'll be right back. 

00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:04.870
 

00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:12.200
 

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:17.120
 WINFREY:  I live for a light bulb moment. 

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:25.200
 Yee-ha!  Yee-ha!  That's great. That's great. 

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.800
 Mrs. KAISER:  Now the next step is three jobs down to one. 

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:29.600
 WINFREY:  Three jobs down to one.  

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:34.840
 Yes.  This is a really good show. 

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:40.110
 Mrs. KAISER:  Plus, today's our anniversary. 

00:40:40.110 --> 00:40:40.860
 WINFREY:  What? 

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:41.710
 Mrs. KAISER:  Today's our anniversary. 

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:43.380
 WINFREY:  And today's your anniversary. 

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:44.140
 Mrs. KAISER:  Fourteen years. 

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:49.090
 WINFREY:  What a gift.  We'll be right back. 

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:51.760
 

00:40:58.370 --> 00:41:05.980
 WINFREY:  Hope Donahue's memoir is "Beautiful Stranger." 

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:09.220
 Dr. Etcoff's book is "Survival of the Prettiest."  

00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:11.470
 That's worth the hour, isn't it, people? 

00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:14.000
 My friends, thank you so much. 

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.390
 Thank you so much. 

00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:17.200
 Mrs. KAISER:  Thank you.
