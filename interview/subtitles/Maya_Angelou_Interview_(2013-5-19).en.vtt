00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:04.590
Oprah:  TODAY ON "SUPER SOUL SUNDAY,"
4

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.750
MY CONVERSATION CONTINUES
5

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.120
WITH MY GREATEST  SPIRITUAL TEACHER.
6

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.790
THAT WAS  LIFE-CHANGING FOR ME.
7

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.720
YES, DARLING.
8

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.850
THE LEGENDARY AUTHOR,  THINKER, POET,
9

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.290
AND MY PERSONAL MENTOR,  DR. MAYA ANGELOU.
10

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.650
I HAVE TO SAY,  I DON'T BELIEVE ANYBODY ON EARTH
11

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.320
HAS TAUGHT ME  MORE THAN MAYA ANGELOU.
12

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.990
I WAS  CRYING HYSTERICALLY,
13

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.890
AND YOU SAID,  "STOP IT, RIGHT NOW."
14

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.150
TODAY, SHE'S BACK  WITH EVEN MORE OF HER WISDOM.
15

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.050
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS
16

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.890
THE BEST PCE OF ADVICE  YOU'VE GIVEN?
17

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.020
HMM.
18

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.590
SHE REVEALS HOW HER TOUGH
19

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.920
BUT TENDERHEARTED MOTHER
20

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.220
TRANSFORMED HER LIFE.
21

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.750
EVEN AT 16,  WHEN YOU BECAME PREGNANT,
22

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.250
SHE DID NOT SHAME YOU.  NOT AT ALL.
23

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.590
AND I GOT TO SAY THIS
24

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.520
NOBODY HAS  BETTER INSIGHT AND PERSPECTIVE
25

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.320
ABOUT AGING BRILLIANTLY.
26

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.690
WHAT CAN YOU SAY  ABOUT THE 80s?
27

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.120
IS IT STILL HOT?  OH, MY GOODNESS.
28

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.750
DO IT, IF YOU CAN.
29

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.520
[ LAUGHS ]
30

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.450
PLUS, THE AHA MOMENT  THAT MOVES MAYA TO TEARS.
31

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.320
IT STILL HUMBLES ME,
32

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.520
AND I'M AMAZED AT IT.
33

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.790
GET READY FOR LIFE LESSONS
34

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.050
AND TO BE INSPIRED
35

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.390
AS ONLY MAYA ANGELOU  CAN DELIVER.
36

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.690
[ LAUGHS ]  THANK GOD FOR THIS.
37

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.090
THAT'S A TWEET.
38

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.890
PART 2 OF  MY HEART-TO-HEART CONVERSATION
39

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.990
WITH THE  PHENOMENAL  MAYA ANGELOU
40

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.590
STARTS NOW.
41

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.020
Oprah:    I WANTED A PLACE FOR PEOPLE
42

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.990
TO GO EVERY SUNDAY TO WAKE UP.
43

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.490
THOUGHT-PROVOKING...
44

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.290
OH, YOU COULDN'T  HAVE SAID THAT BETTER.
45

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.490
...EYE-OPENING, AND INSPIRING.
46

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.150
THIS IS MY FAVORITE THING  TO TALK ABOUT.
47

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.120
THIS WILL LIFT YOU RIGHT ON UP.
48

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.050
IT'S FOOD FOR YOUR SOUL.
49

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.190
EVERY SINGLE SUNDAY.
50

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.590
THIS IS "SUPER SOUL SUNDAY."
51

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.820
52

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.720
LAST TIME, MAYA ANGELOU AND I  REMINISCED ABOUT
53

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.850
SOME OF THE  MOST MEANINGFUL MOMENTS
54

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.250
OF HER EXTRAORDINARY JOURNEY.
55

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.650
WOULD YOU SAY THAT YOU'VE HAD  A LIFE FILLED WITH PIZZAZZ?
56

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.090
YES, I HAVE.
57

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.190
TALK ABOUT PIZZAZZ.
58

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.720
WE MARVELED AT MAYA
59

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.750
IN THIS 1957  CALYPSO SHOWSTOPPER.
60

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.720
61

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.390
MY LORD.  [ LAUGHS ]
62

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.050
AND SHE GAVE US  NEW INSIGHT INTO
63

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.990
BOUNDLESS ACCOMPLISHMENTS  IN HER REMARKABLE LIFE.
64

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.120
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING  WHEN
65

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.250
THE PRESIDENT PLACED THAT MEDAL  AROUND YOUR NECK?
66

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.820
I WAS SO FILLED THAT,
67

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.290
WHEN I WAS  TAKEN OUT OF THAT ROOM,
68

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.720
I SOBBED IN GRATITUDE.
69

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.450
SHE ALSO  SPOKE CANDIDLY AND LOVINGLY
70

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.550
ABOUT HER MOTHER, VIVIAN BAXTER,
71

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.650
A CHARISMATIC, FIERCE,  DYNAMO OF A WOMAN.
72

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.450
[ LAUGHS ]
73

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.320
I WOULDN'T MESS WITH  VIVIAN BAXTER.
74

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.250
NO, NEVER.  YOU DO NOT MESS WITH HER.
75

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.920
NEVER.
76

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.950
THEIR  DEEP SPIRITUAL CONNECTION
77

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.390
IS THE CATALYST  FOR MAYA'S LATEST BOOK.
78

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.490
IT'S CALLED "MOM &amp; ME &amp; MOM."
79

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.420
AT 85, MAYA ANGELOU  IS NOW A GREAT GRANDMOTHER
80

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.950
AND IS STILL  TAKING THE WORLD BY STORM.
81

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.450
IN ADDITION TO HER WRITING
82

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.290
AND FULL SCHEDULE  OF SPEAKING ENGAGEMENTS,
83

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.420
SHE REMAINS EVER RELEVANT,  HIP, AND UP-TO-DATE
84

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.120
WITH HER ACTIVE AND ENLIGHTENING  PRESENCE ON TWITTER.
85

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.020
I'M ONE OF LEGIONS OF READERS  WHO LOOK TO MAYA ANGELOU
86

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.350
FOR COMFORTING WORDS,  FOR COURAGE.
87

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.750
WE SOAK UP HER WISDOM,  WE MARVEL AT HER STAMINA,
88

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.850
AND BASK IN  THE PURE, CONTAGIOUS JOY
89

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.590
SHE TAKES IN LIVING.
90

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.450
Angelou: 82 IS HOT.
91

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.190
82 IS FABULOUS.
92

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.090
I THOUGHT THAT  THE 60s WERE GOOD.
93

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.090
I THOUGHT  THE 60s WERE THE HOTTEST EVER,
94

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.250
AND THEN I GOT INTO THE 70s.
95

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.020
WHAT?
96

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.790
WHAT?
97

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.420
I LOVED THE 70s.
98

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.220
AND I THOUGHT, "WELL, THE 80s  IS GONNA BE SLOWING DOWN."
99

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.150
NOT.
100

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.090
I'M WRITING MUSIC.
101

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.950
I'M WRITING, I'M WORKING,
102

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.050
AND I'M TALKING TO YOU.
103

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.790
OH, YES, 80s  TRY TO MAKE IT.
104

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.920
TRY TO MAKE IT TO 80.
105

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.850
[ LAUGHING ]  IT'S TRUE.
106

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.190
IT'S TRUE?  ABSOLUTELY.
107

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.190
NOW, AS WE SIT HERE,  YOU'RE 85.
108

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.790
YES, MA'AM.  YES, AS WE ARE 85.
109

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.120
WHAT CAN YOU SAY  ABOUT THE 80s?
110

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.450
IS IT STILL HOT?  OH, MY GOODNESS.
111

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.150
DO IT IF YOU CAN.  DO IT IF YOU CAN?
112

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.420
IF YOU HAVE A CHOICE,  CHOOSE THE 80s.
113

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.290
OH, MY GOODNESS.  I MEAN IT.
114

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.650
IF YOU'VE BEEN  CARING FOR YOURSELF,
115

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.790
YOU KNOW,  MODERATION IN ALL THINGS.
116

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.720
AND EVEN  MODERATION IN MODERATION.
117

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.720
DON'T GET  TOO MUCH MODERATION.

MODERATION  IN MODERATION."

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.690
THAT'S RIGHT.  YES.
123

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.350
BUT WHEN YOU  GET INTO YOUR 80s,
124

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.320
AND YOU FIND THAT YOU'RE STILL  LOOKING KIND OF ALL RIGHT,
125

129

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.190
IN THE MAY ISSUE  OF  "O"MAGAZINE,
130

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.090
WE TALK ABOUT  AGING BRILLIANTLY.
131

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.550
TELL ME WHAT YOU'VE LEARNED  YOURSELF ABOUT THE AGING.

AND WHAT A WONDERFUL MENTOR  YOU HAVE BEEN FOR ME
134

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.820
FOR AGING WITH GRACE

AND APPRECIATION AND HEART
136

AND JUST EMBRACING IT.
137

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.790
AND I SEE  SO MANY WOMEN AROUND ME WHO
138

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.520
EVEN AS EARLY AS THEIR 40s,  AND SOME EVEN IN THEIR 30s,
139

JUST FIGHTING IT,  FIGHTING IT ALL THE WAY.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.650
AND I ALWAYS LOOK AT IT AS,  JUST AS YOU WERE SAYING,
143

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.390
"MY GOD, WHATEVER AGE,
144

ALL THE PEOPLE  WHO DIDN'T MAKE IT TO 59.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.420
AND SO, WERE YOU EVER  ANXIOUS ABOUT IT?
149

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.320
WERE YOU EVER, "OH,  I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M TURNING 40.
150

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.420
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M 50."  I CAN'T REMEMBER

EVEN WHEN  I WAS VERY YOUNG.
153

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.120
"THANK YOU,  BECAUSE I KNOW YOU HAVE
178

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.350
SOMETHING BETTER FOR ME  LINED UP."
179

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.390
YES, YEAH.  "THANK YOU."
180

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.420
ONE OF MY  LIFE SEMINAL MOMENTS,
181

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:58.750
I HAD THE FARM IN INDIANA.
182

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.420
YOU REMEMBER THE FARM.  YES, I DO.
183

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.820
AND I WAS  IN THE BATHROOM,
184

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.350
BECAUSE THERE WERE  PEOPLE AT THE HOUSE,
185

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.750
AND I CLOSED THE DOOR,
186

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.220
AND I WAS  SITTING ON THE TOILET SEAT.
187

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.450
AND ON THE BATHROOM PHONE  CALLING YOU,
188

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.020
AND I WAS CRYING HYSTERICALLY  ABOUT SOMETHING.
189

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.620
I DON'T REMEMBER  WHAT IT WAS.
190

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.450
AND YOU SAID
191

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.890
YOU KNOW,  I WAS CALLING FOR YOUR
192

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.420
OPEN, EMPATHETIC,
193

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.950
LOVING EMBRACE,
194

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:22.650
AND YOU SAID, "STOP IT."
195

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.120
THAT'S RIGHT.  "STOP IT RIGHT NOW,
196

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.450
I WANT YOU TO  SAY THANK YOU."
197

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:28.650
AND I WAS, LIKE,  "BUT YOU DIDN'T HEAR ME.
198

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:30.620
YOU DIDN'T HEAR  WHAT I SAID."
199

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.020
AND YOU SAID,  "NO, I WANT  SAY IT.
200

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.790
I WANT TO HEAR YOU  SAY IT."
201

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:35.690
AND I WENT, "THANK YOU.
202

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.220
WHAT AM I  SAYING THANK YOU FOR?"
203

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.920
AND YOU SAID,  "BECAUSE YOU KNOW GOD HAS
204

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.250
PUT A RAINBOW IN THE CLOUDS  FOR YOU."
205

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.920
THAT'S IT.  YEAH.
206

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.350
THAT WAS  LIFE-CHANGING FOR ME.
207

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:46.490
YES, DARLING.
208

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:48.590
YES, DARLING.
209

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:50.120
SO, WHEN WHATEVER IT IS  HITS...
210

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.650
"THANK YOU."  ..."THANK YOU."
211

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:52.690
BECAUSE I KNOW  SOMETHING BETTER
212

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:55.190
IS ON THE ROAD FOR ME,
213

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:57.190
SO, YOU FIRED ME?  GOOD ON YOU.
214

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:00.290
AND VERY GOOD ON ME,
215

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.790
'CAUSE WHAT I'M GOING TO GET,  DARLING, YOU WOULD LONG FOR.
216

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.950
[ LAUGHS ]
217

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.320
DARLING?  YES, DARLING.
218

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.890
SO, WHERE DID YOU  GET THAT?
219

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:10.550
WHERE DID YOU KNOW THAT?
220

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.590
OUT FROM A LONG WAY,  FROM MY GRANDMOTHER,
221

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:15.250
MY FATHER'S MOTHER,  WHO RAISED ME,
222

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:18.990
AND FROM VIVIAN BAXTER.
223

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.350
MAYA DESCRIBES HER MOTHER,  VIVIAN, AS A DYNAMIC WOMAN,
224

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.990
A SPITFIRE WITH  A LARGER-THAN-LIFE PRESENCE,
225

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:25.590
BUT SHE WAS SOMEONE  MAYA DIDN'T REALLY GET TO KNOW
226

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.190
UNTIL HER TEENS.
227

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.090
UNABLE TO RAISE  TWO YOUNG CHILDREN ON HER OWN,
228

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:34.250
VIVIAN BAXTER HAD SENT MAYA  AND HER BROTHER, BAILEY,
229

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.020
TO LIVE WITH THEIR GRANDMOTHER  IN RURAL ARKANSAS.
230

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.650
WHEN MAYA TURNED 13,  SHE REJOINED HER MOTHER
231

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:41.020
IN SAN FRANCISCO.
232

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.050
AND WHILE IT TOOK SOME TIME FOR  THEM TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER,
233

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:46.520
IT WAS OBVIOUS  THERE WAS A LOT OF LOVE
234

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.890
BETWEEN MAYA  AND THE WOMAN SHE CALLED "LADY."
235

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:52.620
VIVIAN BAXTER, SHE
236

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:56.690
SHE LOVED ME.  YES.
237

00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:01.120
AND ENCOURAGED ME  TO DEVELOP COURAGE.
238

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.550
IN STOCKTON, CALIFORNIA,  WHERE SHE LIVED AND DIED,
239

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:07.490
THERE'S A PARK  NAMED FOR HER
240

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:09.620
BECAUSE SHE WAS  THAT KIND TO EVERYBODY
241

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.420
WHITES, BLACKS,  SPANISH SPEAKING,
242

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.150
NATIVE AMERICAN, ASIAN.
243

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.620
SHE WAS THAT KIND.
244

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.720
AND SO, THE NEWEST PARK
245

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.420
IN STOCKTON, CALIFORNIA,
246

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.520
IS CALLED  "LADY BAXTER PARK."
247

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.820
I LOVE THAT.  I LOVE THAT.
248

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.190
AND SO,  THAT'S ON ONE END OF TOWN,
249

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:28.890
AND A LIBRARY  ON THE OTHER END OF TOWN
250

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.350
IS THE MAYA ANGELOU.  MM.
251

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:33.390
IT'S AMAZING BECAUSE
252

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:35.350
THE LIBRARY  WAS NAMED FOR ME
253

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:37.390
BECAUSE OF VIVIAN BAXTER.
254

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:39.490
YOUR MOTHER  PAVED THAT WAY.
255

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:41.720
THAT'S RIGHT.  SHE PAVED THAT WAY,
256

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.650
WHICH WE WERE  TALKING ABOUT LAST WEEK.
257

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:48.450
EVERY TIME  I DARE TO DO A GOOD THING,
258

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:51.320
I'M DOING IT  IN THE NAME OF MY MOTHER.
259

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.590
COMING UP, MAYA SAYS  IF YOU NEED HEALING,
260

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:55.320
THERE'S ONE THING  THAT'S GUARANTEED TO HELP.
261

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.150
LOVE DOES THAT.  LOVE DOES THAT.
262

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.290
LOVE LIBERATES.
263

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:01.720
AND THE TURNING POINT  THAT GAVE MAYA
264

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.250
WHAT SHE CALLS  THE MOST IMPORTANT VIRTUE
265

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:04.850
COURAGE.
266

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:06.250
SHE NEVER, EVER  MADE ME FEEL THAT
267

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:08.920
I HAD  DONE THE WRONG THING.
268

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.590
I KNOW, AND EVEN AT 16,  WHEN YOU BECAME PREGNANT,
269

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:15.720
SHE DID NOT SHAME YOU.  NOT AT ALL.
270

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:21.710
"SUPER SOUL SUNDAY"  WILL BE BACK IN A MOMENT.
271

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:41.520
272

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:47.510
273

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.950
274

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:53.050
Oprah: IN HER LATEST MEMOIR,  MAYA ANGELOU SAYS
275

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:54.720
THE LESSONS FROM HER MOTHER,  VIVIAN BAXTER,
276

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.690
ARE HIGHLIGHTED IN HER MEMORY
277

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.820
LIKE TECHNICOLOR STARS  IN A MIDNIGHT SKY.
278

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.220
Angelou: "MY MOTHER'S  GIFTS OF COURAGE TO ME
279

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.220
"WERE BOTH LARGE AND SMALL.
280

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.220
"THE LATTER ARE WOVEN SO SUBTLY
281

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.590
"INTO THE FABRIC OF MY PSYCHE,
282

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:15.750
"THAT I CAN HARDLY DISTINGUISH
283

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.890
WHERE SHE STOPS AND I BEGIN."
284

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:20.220
YOU SAY THAT  THIS BOOK HAS BEEN WRITTEN
285

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.690
TO EXAMINE SOME OF THE WAYS  THAT LOVE HEALS
286

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:25.790
AND HELPS A PERSON  TO CLIMB TO IMPOSSIBLE HEIGHTS
287

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:27.590
AND RISE  FROM IMMEASURABLY DEPTHS.
288

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:28.620
THAT'S TRUE.  YES.
289

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.220
THAT'S TRUE.
290

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.590
LOVE DOES THAT.  LOVE DOES THAT.
291

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:35.950
LOVE LIBERATES.
292

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:38.320
AND LOVE FROM A PARENT
293

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.720
AND I MEAN  FROM A MOTHER OR A FATHER
294

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.390
LOVE.
295

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:43.790
NOT SENTIMENTALITY,  NOT MUSH,
296

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:46.320
BUT TRUE LOVE.
297

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.950
LOVE THAT  GIVES YOU ENOUGH COURAGE
298

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:51.290
THAT YOU CAN SAY TO SOMEBODY,  "DON'T DO THAT, BABY,"
299

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:53.450
AND THE PERSON WILL KNOW
300

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:55.350
YOU'RE NOT PREACHING,  YOU'RE TEACHING.
301

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:56.850
YES.
302

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:58.850
Oprah: MAYA ANGELOU DEVELOPED
303

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:01.650
AN EVEN DEEPER CONNECTION  TO HER MOTHER
304

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:05.350
WHEN SHE BECAME PREGNANT AT 16.
305

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.450
SHE CALLS THE BIRTH  OF HER ONLY CHILD, HER SON, GUY,
306

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:10.790
THE GREATEST BLESSING  OF HER LIFE.
307

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:12.790
WHEN MAYA TOLD VIVIAN BAXTER  SHE WAS GONNA HAVE A BABY,
308

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:16.450
HER MOTHER DIDN'T GET ANGRY.
309

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:20.290
INSTEAD, SHE WELCOMED  THE BABY BOY INTO THEIR LIVES,
310

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:22.120
EVEN GUIDING THE YOUNG MOTHER  AS SHE STRUCK OUT ON HER OWN.
311

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.550
WHEN GUY WAS  ONLY 2 MONTHS OLD,
312

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:24.890
YOU MOVED OUT OF  THE HOUSE,
313

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:26.220
AND I LOVE THE STORY ABOUT  WHAT YOUR MOTHER
314

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:29.250
SAID TO YOU AS YOU  WERE LEAVING.
315

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:33.220
SHE SAYS, "ALL RIGHT,  YOU GO, BUT REMEMBER THIS.
316

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:36.050
"WHEN YOU CROSS MY DOORSTEP,  YOU HAVE ALREADY BEEN RAISED
317

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:37.390
"WITH WHAT YOU'VE LEARNED FROM  YOUR GRANDMOTHER IN ARKANSAS
318

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:39.890
"AND WHAT YOU'VE LEARNED  FROM ME.
319

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:41.920
"YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG.
320

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.620
"DO RIGHT,  AND DON'T LET ANYBODY RAISE YOU
321

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.150
"FROM THE WAY  YOU'VE BEEN RAISED.
322

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:48.190
"KNOW YOU WILL ALWAYS  HAVE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS
323

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:49.790
"IN LOVE RELATIONSHIPS,  IN FRIENDS,
324

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:52.320
"IN SOCIETY AND WORK,
325

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.850
"BUT DON'T LET ANYBODY  CHANGE YOUR MIND.
326

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:56.050
"AND THEN REMEMBER THIS
327

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:57.720
YOU CAN ALWAYS COME HOME."
328

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.220
SHE DID.  OH!
329

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.720
SHE DID, AND SHE   WHENEVER I'D GO HOME,
330

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.290
THE WORLD WOULD  THROW ME FLAT ON MY FACE
331

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:07.920
WITH THIS LITTLE BABY  I'M TRYING TO RAISE
332

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.690
AND WORK AND SING SONGS  AND DANCE.
333

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:15.820
AND I WOULD GO HOME  TO VIVIAN BAXTER.
334

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:19.650
SHE WOULD ACT AS IF THE BEST  THING HAS EVER HAPPENED.
335

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:22.220
SHE'D CALL HER FRIENDS,  "GIRL, YOU CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
336

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.590
"THE BABY IS HOME.  I'M GONNA COOK THIS FOR HER.
337

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:25.950
"SHE LOVES SPANISH RICE.  I'M GONNA COOK THAT FOR HER.
338

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:27.250
"LISTEN,  DON'T TRY TO COME OVER.
339

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:28.690
"I'M GONNA  HAVE HER TO MYSELF
340

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:30.990
"FOR AT LEAST  THREE OR FOUR HOURS,
341

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:32.920
THEN YOU CAN COME OVER."
342

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.550
SHE NEVER, EVER  MADE ME FEEL THAT
343

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:37.350
I HAD  DONE THE WRONG THING.
344

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:38.850
I KNOW, AND EVEN AT 16,  WHEN YOU BECAME PREGNANT,
345

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:40.450
SHE DID NOT SHAME YOU.  NOT AT ALL.
346

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:41.550
SHE SAID, "WE'RE GONNA  HAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL BABY."
347

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:43.350
THAT'S RIGHT,  AND SHE ASKED ME.
348

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:44.390
SHE SAID, "DO YOU KNOW  WHO THE FATHER IS?"
349

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:46.620
I SAID, "YES.
350

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.650
"I ONLY HAD SEX WITH HIM  ONE TIME,
351

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:51.520
BUT, THEN,  HE'S THE ONLY ONE."
352

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.420
SHE SAID, "ALL RIGHT. DO YOU  LOVE HIM?" I SAID, "NO."
353

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:56.420
SHE ASKED ME, "DOES HE  LOVE YOU?" I SAID, "NO."
354

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.920
SHE SAID, "WE'RE NOT GONNA  RUIN THREE LIVES.
355

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.920
WE'RE GONNA  HAVE A BEAUTIFUL BABY."
356

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.090
WOW.  YES, SHE DID.
357

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:05.490
AND SHE LOVED MY SON.
358

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.750
YES.
359

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:09.050
SHE WAS A KNOCKOUT,  VIVIAN BAXTER.
360

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:10.190
SHE WAS A KNOCKOUT.
361

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:11.990
TELL ME THIS.
362

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:13.820
YOU'VE BEEN  MY GREATEST TEACHER.
363

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.650
WHO'S BEEN  YOUR GREATEST TEACHERS?
364

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:17.190
PROBABLY MY GRANDMOTHER  AND MY MOTHER.
365

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:19.450
REALLY?  MM-HMM.
366

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:21.550
YOUR GREATEST TEACHERS?  MY GREATEST TEACHERS.
367

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:23.820
I WATCHED  GRANDMOTHER HENDERSON,
368

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:27.720
AND I WATCHED  VIVIAN BAXTER.
369

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:31.050
VIVIAN BAXTER  WITH THIS INCREDIBLE ANGER
370

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:34.690
WHENEVER ANYBODY  TRIED TO DO HER DOWN.
371

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:37.990
THIS SAME WOMAN WAS SO KIND,  I NEVER IN MY LIFE
372

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:41.320
SHE WAS VERY PRETTY.
373

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.920
SHE NEVER  LAUGHED AT ANYBODY.
374

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.320
EVER.
375

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.790
I LIKED THAT IN HER.  UH-HUH.
376

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:49.990
BECAUSE  SHE HAD EVERYTHING.
377

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:51.850
SHE HAD MONEY, SHE HAD BEAUTY,  AND HEALTH,
378

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:53.720
AND SHE NEVER  LAUGHED AT ANYBODY.
379

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.950
AND YOU DIDN'T THINK OF YOURSELF  AS A PRETTY GIRL.
380

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:57.390
OH, NO.  I WASN'T A PRETTY GIRL.
381

00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:00.320
THERE WERE PRETTY GIRLS  WHO HAD
382

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.550
LONG HAIR AND FAIR SKIN  AND THAT.
383

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:05.190
AND I WAS SO TALL.
384

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:07.850
I WAS 6' AT 15.
385

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:10.150
SO, HOW DID YOU LEARN TO  LOVE YOURSELF AT THAT TIME?
386

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:11.920
WELL, BAILEY LOVED ME,
387

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.320
MY GRANDMOTHER LOVED ME,
388

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.290
AND MY MOTHER LOVED ME.
389

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:17.990
BECAUSE ANOTHER BOOK  THAT YOU WROTE, THERE'S A POEM,
390

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:19.690
"NOBODY MAKES IT ALONE."
391

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:21.550
NOBODY, BUT NOBODY,  MAKES IT ALONE.
392

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:23.750
NOBODY MAKES IT   NOBODY MAKES IT ALONE,
393

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:26.250
AND EVERYBODY  NEEDS SOMEBODY.
394

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:28.220
AND THAT'S HOW LOVE HEALS.
395

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:31.150
THE LOVE OF THE FAMILY,
396

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:33.990
THE LOVE OF ONE PERSON,  CAN HEAL,
397

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:37.690
SO, IT HEALS THE SCARS LEFT
398

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:41.620
OR WOUNDS LEFT  BY A LARGER SOCIETY,
399

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.150
A MASSIVE,  POWERFUL SOCIETY.
400

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:46.220
401

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.920
COMING UP, THE MOMENT  THAT CHANGED MAYA'S LIFE.
402

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.750
IT STILL HUMBLES ME,
403

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:54.220
AND I'M AMAZED AT IT.
404

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:55.850
AND GRATEFUL FOR IT.
405

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:57.550
SUPER SOULERS,  I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT
406

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:00.090
THE GREATEST TEACHERS  IN YOUR LIVES
407

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:02.890
AND THE LESSONS  THAT INSPIRED YOU.
408

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:05.250
TWEET ME USING 23LoveMaya.
409

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:09.550
OR POST ON FACEBOOK.
410

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:13.650
411

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:17.790
THERE'S AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN  SONG, 19th CENTURY,
412

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:18.990
WHICH IS SO GREAT.
413

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:22.120
IT SAYS...
414

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:25.420
♪ ♪  WHEN IT LOOKED LIKE THE SUN ♪ ♪
415

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:30.190

416

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:31.650

417

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:35.120
IMAGINE.
418

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.050
AND I'VE HAD  SO MANY RAINBOWS IN MY CLOUDS.
419

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:40.390
I HAD A LOT OF CLOUDS.
420

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:44.550
BUT I HAVE HAD SO MANY RAINBOWS.
421

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:47.250
AND THE THING TO DO,  IT SEEMS TO ME,
422

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:49.890
IS TO PREPARE YOURSELF  SO THAT YOU CAN
423

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:52.420
BE A RAINBOW  IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S CLOUD.
424

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:55.020
SOMEBODY  WHO MAY NOT LOOK LIKE YOU,
425

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:57.050
MAY NOT CALL GOD  THE SAME NAME YOU CALL GOD,
426

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:58.890
IF THEY CALL GOD AT ALL.
427

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:02.390
YOU SEE?
428

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:04.750
AND MAY NOT EAT THE SAME DISHES  PREPARED THE WAY YOU DO,
429

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.090
MAY NOT DANCE YOUR DANCES,
430

00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:11.820
OR SPEAK YOUR LANGUAGE.
431

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:15.150
BUT BE A BLESSING TO SOMEBODY.
432

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:17.050
THAT'S WHAT I THINK.
433

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:23.040
434

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:29.490
Angelou: "SUPER SOUL SUNDAY"  WILL BE BACK IN A MOMENT.
435

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:32.050
436

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:34.420
Angelou: WHAT REALLY MATTERS NOW
437

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:37.350
IS LOVE.
438

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:39.950
I MEAN, THAT CONDITION  IN THE HUMAN SPIRIT
439

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:43.390
SO PROFOUND
440

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:46.890
THAT IT ALLOWS US TO RISE.
441

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:50.790
STRENGTH, LOVE,
442

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:54.550
COURAGE, LOVE,
443

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:57.290
KINDNESS, LOVE.
444

00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:59.620
THAT IS REALLY WHAT MATTERS.
445

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.620
THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN EVIL,
446

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:05.190
AND THERE WILL ALWAYS BEEN EVIL,
447

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:07.650
BUT THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN GOOD,
448

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:10.550
AND THERE IS GOOD NOW.
449

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:12.720
YOU SAY WORDS ARE THINGS,
450

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.590
AND THAT  THEY'RE SO POWERFUL.
451

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:17.250
SO, WHAT WORDS DO YOU TURN TO  FOR COMFORT?
452

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:19.520
LOVE.
453

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.520
AND, AGAIN, SEE,  I DON'T MEAN
454

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.690
I THINK  I THINK LOVE IS
455

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:26.090
THAT CONDITION  IN THE HUMAN SPIRIT
456

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:29.420
SO PROFOUND...
457

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:32.020
THAT IT ALLOWS US TO FORGIVE.  MM-HMM.
458

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:34.190
AND IT MAY BE THE ENERGY
459

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:36.090
WHICH KEEPS THE STARS  IN THE FIRMAMENT.
460

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.050
YES.  I'M NOT SURE.
461

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:41.550
IT MAY BE THE ENERGY  WHICH KEEPS
462

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:43.290
THE BLOOD RUNNING SMOOTHLY  THROUGH OUR VEINS.
463

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:48.250
I'M NOT SURE.
464

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:51.620
BUT IT'S SOMETHING  BEYOND THE EXPLANATION.
465

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:55.250
IT CAN BE USED FOR  ANYTHING YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN,
466

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:56.790
ANY GOOD THING  YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN.
467

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:58.190
ABSOLUTELY.
468

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:00.920
YES, MA'AM.
469

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.990
WHERE DO YOU GO  FOR SOLACE, FOR COMFORT?
470

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:05.690
ARE THERE  BOOKS THAT YOU READ?
471

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:07.150
WHEN MAYA ANGELOU  NEEDS COMFORTING,
472

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:10.620
WHAT DO YOU USE?
473

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.290
I'M A STUDENT OF UNITY,
474

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:15.150
AND THERE'S  A BOOK CALLED
475

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:18.650
THE UNITY CHURCH?  UNITY CHURCH.
476

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:21.550
Oprah: MAYA FIRST DISCOVERED  THE UNITY CHURCH IN HER 20s
477

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:23.850
AFTER HER VOICE COACH  AND MENTOR, FRED WILKERSON,
478

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:27.220
INVITED HER TO A SERVICE THERE.
479

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.690
FOUNDED IN 1889,  UNITY IS A CHRISTIAN MOVEMENT
480

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:33.220
THAT EMPHASIZES  AFFIRMATIVE PRAYER AND EDUCATION
481

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:38.750
AS A PATH TO SPIRITUALITY.
482

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:41.320
I TOOK A COURSE IN UNITY  ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO ONLINE.
483

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:44.020
NOT TO BECOME  A MEMBER OR MINISTER,
484

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.520
BUT JUST TO  UNDERSTAND MORE DEEPLY.
485

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.420
THERE'S A BOOK CALLED  "LESSONS IN TRUTH."
486

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:51.720
WOW.  AND IN THE BOOK,
487

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:55.490
THERE'S A LINE WHICH IS,  "GOD LOVES ME."
488

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:57.990
AND WHEN I CAME TO READ IT  TO MY THEN-MENTOR,
489

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:00.350
FREDERICK WILKERSON,
490

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:02.090
THE LATE  FREDERICK WILKERSON,
491

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:03.190
I READ, "GOD LOVES ME."
492

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:04.650
AND HE SAID,  "READ IT AGAIN."
493

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:06.850
I SAID,  "GOD LOVES ME."
494

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:08.350
HE SAID, "READ IT AGAIN."  MM.
495

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:13.590
"READ IT AGAIN."
496

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:15.450
AND FINALLY, I SAID,  "GOD...LOVES...ME."
497

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:20.750
[ SIGHS ]
498

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:23.420
499

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:25.920
IT STILL HUMBLES ME,
500

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:29.350
THAT THIS FORCE WHICH MADE
501

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:32.490
LEAVES AND FLEAS  AND STARS
502

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:34.590
AND RIVERS AND YOU
503

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:36.720
LOVES ME.
504

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.720
ME, MAYA ANGELOU.
505

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:41.520
IT'S AMAZING!
506

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.890
I CAN DO ANYTHING   AND DO IT WELL.
507

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:47.620
ANY GOOD THING,  I CAN DO IT.
508

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:51.990
THAT'S WHY  I AM WHO I AM. YES.
509

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:54.850
BECAUSE GOD LOVES ME,  AND I'M AMAZED AT IT!
510

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:58.290
AND GRATEFUL FOR IT.
511

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:01.950
512

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:05.020
DO YOU FEEL CARRIED  BY THE ANCESTORS AS I DO?
513

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.390
DO YOU FEEL CARRIED BY THEM?  ABSOLUTELY.
514

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:10.050
WHEN YOU SAID, WHEN WE  TALKED LAST WEEK ABOUT,
515

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:12.090
"YOUR CROWN  HAS BEEN PAID FOR.
516

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:13.290
PUT IT ON YOUR HEAD  AND WEAR IT."
517

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:14.820
YES.  YEAH.
518

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:18.450
DO YOU FEEL
519

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:20.520
DO YOU FEEL THAT  YOUR GRANDMOTHER
520

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.650
AND HER MOTHER BEFORE HER.  YES, AND GREAT GRANDMOTHER.
521

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:23.550
AND GREAT GRANDMOTHER.
522

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:24.990
WHO HAD BEEN BORN A SLAVE.  BEEN BORN A SLAVE.
523

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:28.950
DO YOU FEEL THAT  YOU'RE CARRIED BY THAT?
524

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:32.190
ABSOLUTELY,  AND I'M RESPONSIBLE TO THEM.
525

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:34.850
MAYA HAS SPOKEN OFTEN  ABOUT THAT RESPONSIBILITY.
526

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:37.450
LISTEN TO THIS FROM 2003.
527

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:39.950
IMAGINE IT. JUST IMAGINE.
528

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:43.090
ANY OF US,  IF WE COULD REALLY THINK OF
529

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:46.150
OUR GREAT GRANDFATHERS  AND GRANDMOTHERS,
530

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:48.690
AND IF  PUT THEM  RIGHT IN FRONT OF US TODAY
531

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:52.550
AND SAY, "HERE YOU ARE.
532

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:55.020
"ARE YOU PLEASED WITH  WHAT I'M DOING WITH MY LIFE?
533

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:59.290
"AM I MAKING YOU PROUD?
534

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:01.550
AM I DOING ALL  YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO BE DOING?"
535

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:04.690
BECAUSE A PERSON COULD SAY,
536

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:07.320
"YOU'RE THE REASON  I CAME OVER HERE ON THAT BOAT.
537

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:11.790
YOU'RE THE REASON  I STOOD ON THE AUCTION BLOCK.
538

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:13.320
YOU'RE THE R I STUCK IT SO  THAT YOU COULD EXIST."
539

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:18.320
540

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.120
SUDDENLY,  LIFE ITSELF IS RICHER.
541

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.150
SO, WHEREVER I AM,
542

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:25.390
I STAND ON THE STAGE  IN FRONT OF 10,000 PEOPLE,
543

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:26.620
MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER  STANDS THERE WITH ME.
544

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:28.920
MM-HMM.
545

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.390
THAT'S THE LINE IN THE POEM,  "GRANDMOTHERS,"
546

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:31.720
THAT YOU WROTE   ONE OF MY FAVORITES.
547

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.320
I COME AS ONE,
548

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:34.750
"I STAND AS TEN THOUSAND."  "I STAND AS TEN THOUSAND."
549

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:37.790
OH, MY GOSH.
550

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:39.390
I USE THAT LINE  FOR MYSELF INTERNALLY
551

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:41.150
ON MANY AN OCCASION.
552

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:42.850
YES, BECAUSE  THAT'S WHO YOU ARE.
553

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:45.590
I'VE RECITED THAT TO MYSELF  MANY TIMES.
554

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:46.620
"I COME AS ONE,  BUT I STAND AS TEN THOUSAND."
555

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:47.820
THAT'S IT.  YEAH.
556

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:49.490
YOU GIRL.
557

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:50.590
THE FORCE OF THAT.  THAT'S IT.
558

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:52.290
YES, MA'AM.  THE FORCE OF THAT.
559

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:53.420
TO KNOW THAT  NONE OF US ARE ALONE.
560

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:54.690
NO, EVER.
561

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:55.820
'CAUSE YOU'VE BEEN  PAID FOR!
562

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:57.350
ALREADY.
563

00:22:57.350 --> 00:23:00.320
ALREADY.  THANK THE LORD.
564

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.920
[ LAUGHS ]
565

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.620
COMING UP, WE ALL KNOW  SHE'S FULL OF LIFE LESSONS,
566

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.490
BUT WHICH ONE  IS MAYA ANGELOU'S FAVORITE?
567

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:09.590
EVERYBODY WHO QUOTES YOU,  AND I QUOTE YOU,
568

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:10.920
AND THEN THEY  QUOTE ME THROUGH YOU AND ALL.
569

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.390
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS
570

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:15.750
THE BEST PCE OF ADVICE  YOU'VE GIVEN?
571

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:17.150
WELL, HMM.
572

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:18.490
HMM.
573

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:20.890
MAYA'S ANSWER
574

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:23.790
WHEN "SUPER SOUL SUNDAY"  RETURNS.
575

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:26.120
PLUS, WHAT YOU,  OUR SUPER SOULERS,
576

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.450
WANT TO SAY TO MAYA ANGELOU.
577

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:34.440
WE'LL BE BACK IN A MOMENT.
578

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.720
579

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.650
580

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:48.850
Oprah: YOU KNOW,  I LOVED SHARING MAYA'S WISDOM
581

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:51.250
ON THE "OPRAH" SHOW  OVER ALL THESE YEARS,
582

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:55.020
AND OF ALL THE LESSONS  I'VE LEARNED IN MY LIFE,
583

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:58.320
THIS ONE'S AT THE VERY TOP  OF MY "MAYA LIST."
584

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.090
WHEN PEOPLE SHOW YOU  WHO THEY ARE,
585

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:01.290
BELIEVE THEM.  Angelou: YES.
586

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:03.050
ABSOLUTELY.
587

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:05.250
A PERSON SAYS TO YOU,
588

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:08.320
"I'M SELFISH,"
589

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:12.490
OR, "I'M MEAN,"
590

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:14.920
OR, "I AM UNKIND."
591

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.590
OR, "I'M CRAZY."
592

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:18.950
BELIEVE THEM   THEY KNOW THEMSELVES
593

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:21.350
MUCH BETTER THAN YOU DO.  MM-HMM.
594

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:23.190
IN 2000,  WHEN YOU WERE 72,
595

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:25.590
I INTERVIEWED YOU  FOR THE MAGAZINE,
596

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:28.150
AND I ASKED YOU  IF YOU CONSIDERED YOURSELF WISE,
597

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:29.350
AND AT THE TIME, YOU ANSWERED,  "WELL, I'M EN ROUTE."
598

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:30.650
THAT'S TRUE.
599

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:32.090
AND HOW WOULD YOU  ANSWER THAT NOW?
600

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:33.750
I'M EN ROUTE.  YOU'RE STILL EN ROUTE?
601

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:35.250
I'M FURTHER ALONG  THAN I WAS.
602

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:37.220
[ BOTH LAUGH ]
603

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:38.350
BUT I'M STILL EN ROUTE.
604

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:41.720
MM-HMM.
605

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.620
I DON'T KNOW  WHEN I KNOW ENOUGH.
606

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:46.050
I KNOW I KNOW A LOT,
607

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:50.090
AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR THAT.
608

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:52.020
I KNOW ENOUGH TO TRY TO
609

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:53.950
TO LIVE WHAT I KNOW.
610

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:55.750
MM-HMM.  NOW, THAT'S A LOT.
611

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:58.150
WHOA, THAT'S A LOT.
612

00:24:58.150 --> 00:25:00.890
BUT I STILL  DON'T HAVE IT ALL.
613

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:02.690
WHAT DO YOU THINK  THAT YOU, MAYA ANGELOU
614

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:04.550
EVERYBODY WHO QUOTES YOU,  AND I QUOTE YOU,
615

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:06.090
AND THEN THEY  QUOTE ME THROUGH YOU AND ALL.
616

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:08.790
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS
617

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:11.920
THE BEST PCE OF ADVICE  YOU'VE GIVEN?
618

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.990
WELL, HMM.
619

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:15.590
HMM.
620

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:19.720
WELL, I'M THINKING THAT
621

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:23.220
THE BEST ADVICE  I'VE EVER GIVEN, I HOPE,
622

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:26.290
WAS THAT  WHICH I GAVE TO MY SON
623

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:29.320
WHEN HE WAS GROWING UP.
624

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:32.720
HE SAID,  "I DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS.
625

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:36.390
HOW CAN I  GET SOME FRIENDS?"
626

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:38.520
AND ALTHOUGH  I WAS VERY YOUNG,
627

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:41.920
I TOLD HIM TWO THINGS.
628

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.450
I TOLD HIM,  IN ORDER TO GET A FRIEND,
629

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:47.690
YOU HAVE TO BE A FRIEND   BE READY TO BE A FRIEND.
630

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:53.520
AND ALSO, I TOLD HIM,
631

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:57.650
THERE'S A PLACE IN YOU  THAT YOU MUST KEEP INVIOLATE.
632

00:25:57.650 --> 00:25:59.890
YOU MUST KEEP IT  PRISTINE, CLEAN,
633

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:01.990
SO THAT  NOBODY HAS THE RIGHT TO
634

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:06.390
CURSE YOU  OR TREAT YOU BADLY.
635

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:08.850
NOBODY, NO MOTHER, FATHER,  NO WIFE, NO HUSBAND, NOBODY,
636

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:10.450
BECAUSE THAT MAY BE  THE PLACE YOU GO TO
637

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:12.250
WHEN YOU MEET GOD.
638

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:14.790
YOU HAVE TO HAVE  A PLACE THAT YOU SAY,
639

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:17.420
"STOP IT, BACK UP."
640

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:19.220
NOT HERE, YOU WON'T.  NOT  NO.
641

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:22.290
ABSOLUTELY.
642

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:24.520
AND THAT'S ONE I TOLD YOU  25 YEARS AGO.
643

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.020
YES.  SAY, "NO," WHEN IT'S NO.
644

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:31.620
YEAH.  SAY SO. BACK IT UP.
645

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:33.520
BECAUSE THAT PLACE  HAS TO REMAIN CLEAN AND CLEAR.
646

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.390
AND THAT HAS TO BE  A PLACE WITHIN YOURSELF.
647

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:35.990
YES, MA'AM.  YEAH.
648

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:37.920
THAT IS THE BEST ADVICE.
649

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.690
I KNOW EVERYBODY WHO'S WATCHING  IS GONNA SAY,
650

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:41.150
"WHEN PEOPLE SHOW YOU  WHO THEY ARE, BELIEVE THEM."
651

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:43.020
THAT'S ALSO VERY GOOD.
652

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:46.020
IT IS GOOD, NOW.  YEAH.
653

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:48.890
BUT NOTHING TOPS  HAVING THE PLACE INSIDE YOURSELF
654

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:50.450
THAT NOBODY ELSE  HAS A RIGHT TO INVADE.
655

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:55.250
NO.  YES.
656

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:58.690
AND WHEN THE PERSON COMES  WITH RUDE LANGUAGE TO YOU,
657

00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:01.190
OR INVASIVE LANGUAGE  TO YOU,
658

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:03.590
YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SAY,  "BACK UP.
659

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:06.390
"NOT ME, YOU DON'T.
660

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:07.950
DON'T YOU KNOW  I'M A CHILD OF GOD?"
661

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:11.950
662

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:14.150
WHAT IS THE BEST PCE OF ADVICE  YOU'VE EVER GOTTEN?
663

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:16.850
MM, SO MANY GOOD THINGS.
664

00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:18.650
[ LAUGHS ] I KNOW.  YEAH.
665

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:22.990
666

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:26.490
I GUESS THE GREATEST ADVICE  IS TO FORGIVE.
667

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:28.220
I DON'T  ANOINT IT WITH ANYTHING.
668

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.320
I JUST FORGIVE IT.
669

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:31.350
BUT DON'T WE FORGIVE
670

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:33.920
I'VE TRIED TO  LET PEOPLE KNOW ON THE SHOW,
671

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:36.390
AS YOU HAVE TAUGHT ME  OVER THE YEARS THAT,
672

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:38.090
WHEN YOU FORGIVE SOMEBODY,  IT DOESN'T MEAN
673

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:39.290
YOU WANT TO SIT DOWN  AND INVITE THEM TO YOUR TABLE.
674

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:40.620
OH, NO.  NO, NO, NO, NO.
675

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:42.450
INDEED, NOT.  MM-HMM.
676

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:44.150
I JUST MEAN,  "I'M FINISHED WITH YOU."
677

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:45.950
"I'M DONE."  "YOU CAN GO AWAY."
678

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:49.550
YES.  YES, "YOU GO AWAY."
679

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:51.690
NOW, I DON'T  I DON'T SAY  GO AWAY AND HARM SOMEBODY ELSE,
680

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:55.390
BUT I DO HAVE TO  PROTECT MYSELF.
681

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:57.520
I LOOK LIKE A NINNY IF I  ASK SOMEBODY ELSE TO PROTECT ME,
682

00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:58.990
AND I'M NOT WILLING TO  PROTECT MYSELF.
683

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:00.420
YEAH, THAT'S ONE OF  THE GREAT LESSONS
684

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:02.820
THAT YOU'VE TAUGHT ME,  TOO.
685

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:04.720
YOU'VE GOT TO BE WILLING TO  TAKE CARE OF THIS FIRST.
686

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.920
YES, MA'AM.  THEN YOU HAVE ENOUGH
687

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:10.790
TO GIVE TO OTHER PEOPLE.  YES, MA'AM.
688

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:13.350
COMING UP, WE'RE GOING  SOUL-TO-SOUL WITH MAYA ANGELOU.
689

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:14.820

690

HOW MAYA HAS TOUCHED YOUR LIVES,

00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:35.350
DR. ANGELOU,  WHAT IS YOUR DEFINITION OF GOD?
720

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:37.890
OOH.
721

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:40.250
[ LAUGHS ]  HMM.
722

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:42.220

IF I COULD SAY
724

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:47.520
IF I WAS ASKED,  SAY IT IN

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.050
YOUR DEFINITION OF GOD  IN ONE WORD,
726

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:50.550
IT WOULD BE, "ALL."
727

00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:52.450
A-L-L.
728

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:55.620
I LOVE THAT.
729

00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:57.890
THERE IS NO PLACE  THAT GOD IS NOT.
730

00:29:57.890 --> 00:29:59.390
NO PLACE.

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:02.520

ON MY KNEES,  GOD IS RIGHT THERE.
735

ALL.  GOD IS ALL.
736

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:15.990
ARE THERE MANY WAYS  TO GET TO HIM?
737

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:19.690
I THINK SO, AS MANY WAYS  AS THERE ARE, ABSOLUTELY.
738

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:22.720
LIKE THE WAY,  THE HIGHWAYS THAT GO TO ROME,
739

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.890
BUT ALL ROADS LEAD TO GOD.  YES.
740

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:26.750
WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE HAPPENS  WHEN YOU DIE?
741

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:28.920
OH, I GO BACK TO ALL.
742

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:30.690
[ BOTH LAUGH ]

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:34.290
THAT'S ALL.  YOU GO BACK TO ALL?
744

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:36.290
YES. I'M IN ALL RIGHT NOW,  I JUST GO BACK TO ALL.
745

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:38.350
GO BACK TO ALL?  YES, ANOTHER
746

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:40.020
IT'S JUST ANOTHER WAY  OF BEING IN THE ALL.
747

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:41.720
YES, AND IT'S  SO INTERESTING,
748

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.150
'CAUSE YOU'RE  THE FIRST PERSON
749

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:46.490
THAT SAID TO ME  IN A WAY I REALLY GOT
750

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:49.220
THAT THERE ARE  AS MANY LEVELS
751

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:50.620
YOU SAID THAT EVERYBODY THINKS  THAT THERE'S JUST ONE WAY.
752

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:52.550
THERE'S NOT JUST ONE GATE.
753

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:54.220
THERE ARE AS MANY GATES  AS THERE ARE PEOPLE.
754

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:56.250
THERE ARE AS MANY GATES  AS ARE PEOPLE.
755

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:57.950
AND THEN  DR. EBEN ALEXANDER'S BOOK,
756

00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:01.690
"IN PROOF OF HEAVEN."  OH, YES.
757

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:02.950
HE TALKS ABOUT ALL OF  THE DIFFERENT, MULTIPLE LEVELS.
758

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:04.450
EXACTLY.  YES.
759

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:08.150
I LOVE THAT BOOK,  BY THE WAY.
760

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:09.920
AND THEN TO FIND  AND TO SEE HIM ON "SUPER SOUL"
761

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.220
JUST KNOCKED MY SOCKS OFF.  [ LAUGHS ]
762

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:12.820
AMAZING.
763

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:14.420
WHAT DO YOU CALL  THE SOUL?
764

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:17.390
WHAT IS IT?
765

00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:20.520
WHAT IS THE SOUL?
766

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:22.520
THE SOUL IS THE SPIRIT
767

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:23.920
WHICH LONGS FOR ALL.
768

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:29.090
OOH.
769

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:31.790
AND THAT SPIRIT  THEN USES ITSELF
770

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:34.590
TO CREATE THE BLUES
771

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:37.620
AND GOSPEL MUSIC
772

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:40.650
AND POP MUSIC AND HIP-HOP.
773

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:42.190
IT'S THAT SPIRIT  THAT LONGS,
774

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:45.620
THAT SAYS,
775

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:49.220
"LET ME SAY SOMETHING
776

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:54.020
"WHICH WILL HELP ME,  LEAD ME TO ALL,

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:08.650
THE POETRY.
783

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:11.590
I WRITE IT  SO I CAN GET CLOSER TO ALL.
784

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:14.450
LET ME TELL SO MUCH TRUTH.
785

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:16.150
NOT FACTS, BECAUSE  FACTS CAN OBSCURE THE TRUTH.
786

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:17.850
MM-HMM.  YOU TELL SO MANY FACTS
787

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:19.190
THE PLACES WHERE,  THE PEOPLE WHO,
788

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:20.450
TIMES WHEN,  THE REASONS WHY,

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:22.690
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,
790

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:25.990
NEVER GETTING TO  THE TRUTH.
791

00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:29.250
SO, I WANT TO  TELL THE TRUTH IN MY WORK.
792

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:30.890
AND IT WILL HELP ME,  LEAD ME CLOSER TO ALL.
793

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:33.320
AND IS  DO YOU SEE
794

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:36.750
I REMEMBER RAINN WILSON  WAS ON "SUPER SOUL SUNDAY,"
795

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:37.820
AND HE SAID THAT ART IS  ANOTHER FORM OF PRAYER.
796

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:39.720
OF COURSE.
797

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.950
YEAH, YOU SEE THAT, TOO?  EXACTLY.
798

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:44.290
THAT'S WHY  YOU TRY YOUR BEST
799

00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:45.720
TO SAY THE RIGHT THING,  THE TRUE THING.
800

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.750
MM-HMM.  THE GOOD THING.
801

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:50.650
BECAUSE YOU'RE AN ARTIST,
802

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:53.420
AND YOU'RE USING  GOD ITSELF
803

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:55.120
TO HELP YOU TO GET TO GOD.
804

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.650
OH, YES.
805

00:32:57.650 --> 00:32:59.490
HOW DO YOU DEFINE  SPIRITUALITY
806

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:03.290
VERSUS RELIGION?
807

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:05.820
OH, RELIGION  IS LIKE A MAP.
808

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:07.820
IT CAN HELP YOU TO SEE
809

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.620
HOW TO GET  WHERE YOU WANT TO GO.
810

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:12.420
ALL IT DOES  IS SHOW YOU HOW TO GET THERE.
811

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:14.620
IT'S ONLY A MAP.  YEAH.
812

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:15.890
AND SPIRITUALITY FOR YOU  MEANS...?
813

00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:18.790
OH.
814

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:21.550
SURRENDER.
815

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:23.550
I SURRENDER ALL TO ALL.
816

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:25.620
COMING UP,  I KNEW MAYA WOULD HAVE
817

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:27.550
A GREAT RESPONSE  TO THIS QUESTION.
818

00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:29.290
WHAT DOES PRAYER  MEAN TO YOU?
819

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:31.920
OH, I KNOW  YOU'RE A PRAYING WOMAN.
820

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:34.420
I'M A PRAYING WOMAN.  YOU'RE A PRAYING WOMAN.
821

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:36.320
PLUS, MAYA ANGELOU'S  PROFOUND WORDS
822

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:40.320
THAT INSPIRED A NATION.
823

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.950
LIFT UP YOUR EYES  UPON THIS DAY BREAKING FOR YOU.
824

00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:47.320
GIVE BIRTH AGAIN TO THE DREAM.
825

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:50.290
826

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:52.220
WELL, WHEN YOU WROTE IT,  I WANT TO KNOW
827

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:54.550
HEAR FROM YOUR MOUTH
828

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:58.450
WHY YOU KNOW  THE CAGED BIRD SINGS.
829

00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:00.490
THE CAGED BIRD SINGS  BECAUSE IT MUST.
830

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:03.220
IT MUST OR DIE.
831

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:05.390
MAYBE IT MUST  ANDDIE.  I DON'T KNOW.
832

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:10.420
BUT IT MUST SING.
833

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:14.820
SOMETIMES, THE MELODY  ARRIVED AT IN THE CAGE
834

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:18.920
IS MUCH MORE FETCHING,  MUCH MORE APPEALING,
835

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:22.150
MUCH MORE PROFOUND,  MUCH MORE POIGNANT,
836

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:24.890
THAN THE MELODY ARRIVED AT
837

00:34:24.890 --> 00:34:29.990
BY THE BIRD  WHO'S ON THE LOOSE.
838

00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:34.150
THE CAGED BIRD  SINGS WITH A FEARFUL TRILL.
839

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:36.750
ITS SONG IS HEARD  ON THE DISTANT HILL,
840

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:38.150
FOR THE CAGED BIRD  SINGS OF FREEDOM.
841

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:42.120
FREEDOM.
842

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:45.750
AND SO, THERE'S SOMETHING  UNIVERSAL ABOUT THAT SONG,
843

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:48.350
SINCE ALL OF US ARE CAGED  IN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER,
844

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:51.350
AND SO, PEOPLE CAN HEAR IT  AND SAY,
845

00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:57.340
"OH, YES, OH, LORD,  LET THAT BIRD OUT."
846

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:12.990
847

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:15.290
Oprah: "SUPER SOUL SUNDAY"  WILL BE BACK IN A MOMENT.
848

00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:18.850
849

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:21.120
850

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.790
WHAT DOES PRAYER  MEAN TO YOU?
851

00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:24.650
OH, I KNOW  YOU'RE A PRAYING WOMAN.
852

00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:26.390
I'M A PRAYING WOMAN.  YOU'RE A PRAYING WOMAN.
853

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:27.750
YES, I AM.  YEAH.
854

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:29.250
SO, WHEN YOU SAY TO ME
855

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:30.690
THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES  YOU'VE SAID TO ME,
856

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:31.790
"I'M PRAYING FOR YOU."  MM-HMM.
857

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:33.190
"AND I'M PRAYING WITH YOU."
858

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:34.150
I KNOW  I'M GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.
859

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:35.420
[ LAUGHS ] I KNOW.  I KNOW.
860

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:37.590
IT CHANGES THINGS.
861

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:39.420
AND YOU'RE CONNECTED.  YES, I AM.
862

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:41.120
AND I THANK GOD FOR THAT.
863

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:43.620
I KNOW THAT, WHEN I PRAY,
864

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:48.220
SOMETHING WONDERFUL  HAPPENS.
865

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:53.050
NOT JUST TO THE PERSON  OR PERSONS FOR WHOM I'M PRAYING,
866

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:56.490
BUT ALSO SOMETHING WONDERFUL  HAPPENS TO ME.
867

00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:58.120
I'M GRATEFUL  THAT I'M HEARD.
868

00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.290
MM.
869

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:01.790
'CAUSE YOU KNOW  ALL HEARS IT ALL.
870

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:03.590
THAT'S IT.
871

00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:05.220
WHERE DO YOU FEEL  MOST AT HOME
872

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:06.220
OR AT PEACE  WITH YOURSELF?
873

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:07.550
WITH MYSELF?
874

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:10.350
IN MYSELF.
875

00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:13.150
ALWAYS,  WHEN I'M IN MYSELF.
876

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:17.020
THAT IS TO SAY,
877

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:21.120
I'M AT PEACE WITH YOU.
878

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.820
I'M AT PEACE WITH  40,000 CAMERAS ZOOMING AROUND,
879

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:25.450
THAT'S FINE.
880

00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:28.550
I'M AT PEACE IN MY BUS.
881

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:30.790
I'M AT PEACE STANDING  IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE,
882

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:33.290
AS I DID  A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO,
883

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:34.790
FOR 10,000 PEOPLE.
884

00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:36.790
I'M AT PEACE.
885

00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:39.850
ONCE I KNOW I AM CENTERED,
886

00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:42.220
IN GOD, I LIVE AND MOVE  AND HAVE MY BEING.
887

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:43.820
I'M ALL RIGHT, JACK.
888

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:45.220
I'M ALL RIGHT.
889

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:47.890
NOW, WHEN I LOSE IT,
890

00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:49.720
AS YOU DO LOSE IT  FROM TIME TO TIME
891

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:51.950
IT IS HUMAN, I THINK
892

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:55.120
IT'S UNFORTUNATE,  BUT THERE WE ARE.
893

00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:57.620
SO, FAITH TREMBLES
894

00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:00.990
AND SKIDS AWAY.
895

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:04.420
AND SO, FOR THAT MOMENT,
896

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:05.750
I'M DANGEROUS,  AND I'M IN DANGER.
897

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:09.220
YES.
898

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:12.720
BUT AS SOON AS  I MAKE THE STATEMENT,
899

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.590
"IN GOD, I LIVE AND MOVE  AND HAVE MY BEING," I'M FINE.
900

00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:17.420
I THANK YOU.  I'M FINE.
901

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:20.390
AND I USE THAT PHRASE   I USE THAT TO CALM MYSELF.
902

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:22.950
THAT IS MY LIVING MANTRA  FOR MYSELF.
903

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:25.950
IN ALL  DIFFICULT SITUATIONS.
904

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:28.420
AND IN ALSO GOOD ONES,  I USE, "IN GOD, I MOVE."
905

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:32.520
'CAUSE WHEN YOU USE IT  IN GOOD TIMES,
906

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:36.620
THE ALL IS PLEASED,  'CAUSE IT KNOWS THAT
907

00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:38.420
YOU KNOW THAT YOUR GOOD TIMES  WERE BECAUSE OF IT.
908

00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:40.020
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.
909

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:41.350
YES, SO,  YOU'RE JUST SAYING "THANK YOU."
910

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:44.790
THANK YOU.
911

00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:50.450
AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW FOR SURE,  MAYA ANGELOU?
912

00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:53.750
I KNOW FOR SURE  THAT LOVE SAVES ME,
913

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:57.450
AND THAT IT IS HERE  TO SAVE US ALL.
914

00:37:57.450 --> 00:38:02.150
I KNOW IT'S A SENSE.
915

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:04.450
IT'S MORE CLOSE TO US  THAN AIR.
916

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:09.690

I KNOW THAT  WE CAN SIT IN IT.
921

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:22.050
YES, LOVE, HONEY.
922

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:24.650
AND YOU KNOW BY THAT,  I DON'T MEAN MUSH, OR ANY
923

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:26.750
I DON'T MEAN ROMANCE.  OR SENTIMENTALITY.
924

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:29.990
I DO NOT, NO, MA'AM.
925

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:33.590
I MEAN  SOMETHING IS SO

928

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:43.550
IT CAN  MAKE A MOUNTAIN MOVE.

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:46.020
I KNOW IT.
930

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:48.050
I HAVEN'T DONE IT,  BUT I KNOW IT.
931

00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:51.750
AS SURELY AS  I'M SITTING HERE.
932

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:53.750

934

00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:56.350
